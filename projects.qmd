## 758 Final Project

The raw dataset of approximately 8,000 YouTube comments, initially spread across six files, underwent a systematic cleaning process to prepare it for textual analysis. We first streamlined the data by retaining only the comment text, like counts, and reply status. Utilizing the `stringr` package, we normalized all whitespace and implemented crucial character filtering, deliberately preserving the full integrity of all Chinese characters to maintain cultural and contextual authenticity. The final output ensured a tidy, standardized dataset, encoded in **UTF-8**, making it immediately ready for downstream procedures like tokenization and sentiment analysis.

## 604 Final Project

This project explores public trust in AI by analyzing YouTube comments. The methodology involves: selecting top global news organizations (e.g., BBC, CNN) and identifying their most-viewed, AI-focused videos. Using the YouTube API, comments are collected, cleaned to remove spam and irrelevant content, and then categorized. The final step is sentiment analysis, sorting comments into three groups—trust, distrust, or neutral—to assess audience perception of AI decision-making.
