I utilized an R scraping script to extract approximately 8,000 comments in total. Following a cleaning and filtering process, a dataset of around 7,000 practical comments was retained for analysis.\nI specifically focused on the case study known as the “胖貓跳江事件” (Suicide of Fat Cat). This event, which occurred in Mainland China, provides a particularly rich and relevant dataset because it was a well-documented news story officially reported by the Chinese court. This official documentation makes it a real and verifiable event, distinguishing it from mere rumors or social media anecdotes. Furthermore, the use of Chinese-language videos as the reference source is critical, as the Chinese-speaking audience possesses extensive background knowledge and cultural context directly related to the local details of this incident.\n\nSIMP001 - 陪打遊戲賺百萬養女友慘遭分手！「胖貓事件」引爆中國性別戰爭？「撈女」滿街跑的背後原因？【TODAY 看世界】(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TfkwlthWU&t=13s) 1952 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP002 - 当胖猫遇到捞女，一个年轻人如何走上不归路？｜女权｜捞女｜胖猫｜王者荣耀｜男女平权｜日本｜梅大高速｜舆论控制｜王局拍案20240507 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Gq_eOPuDY&t=1s) 3731 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP003 - 老梁：给“胖猫”多条选择 重庆“胖猫事件”不是性别大战 如何避免成为“胖猫”(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjcgg0wFpfE) 997 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP004 - 小伙為愛跳江，拜金的女友，吸血的親姐，無良的商家，瘋狂的網民，誰才是加害者？為何警察認定女友無罪，反而是親姐違了法？一口氣看完胖貓事件始末！| Wayne調查(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igs7GoIU4MU) 615 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP005 - 神級陪玩「胖貓」遭詐乾227萬亡 女友道歉｜20240506 ET午間新聞 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE83zZEcOY) 402 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP006 - 被撈女騙光50萬，遊戲宅男跳江自殺，轟動全網！撈女譚竹榨乾胖貓事件真相！『新闻最嘲点 姜光宇』2024.0508(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYngd2Yt3zk) 271 comments from 11/04/2025\n\n\nlibrary(plyr)\n\nWarning: package 'plyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise,\n    summarize\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nWarning: package 'tidytext' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'purrr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    compact\n\nlibrary(chromote)\n\nWarning: package 'chromote' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(stargazer)\n\n\nPlease cite as: \n\n\n Hlavac, Marek (2022). stargazer: Well-Formatted Regression and Summary Statistics Tables.\n\n\n R package version 5.2.3. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stargazer \n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\nWarning: package 'corrplot' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n\nlibrary(tm)\n\nWarning: package 'tm' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: NLP\n\n\nWarning: package 'NLP' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'NLP'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\nlibrary(wordcloud)\n\nWarning: package 'wordcloud' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: RColorBrewer\n\nlibrary(quanteda)\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nPackage version: 4.3.1\nUnicode version: 15.1\nICU version: 74.1\n\n\nParallel computing: 12 of 12 threads used.\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'quanteda'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    meta, meta&lt;-\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nWarning: package 'rvest' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textplots\")\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textplots' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr)\n\nWarning: package 'httr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'httr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    content\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(RedditExtractoR)\n\nWarning: package 'RedditExtractoR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nWarning: package 'httr2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments.csv\")\ndata3 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments.csv\")\ndata4 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments.csv\")\ndata5 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments.csv\")\ndata6 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments.csv\")"

The original structure included columns such as: videoId, commentId, parentId, author, text, likeCount, publishedAt, updatedAt, viewerRating, canRate, and reply.\nFor data cleaning, all CSV files in the Final_project_data folder were systematically processed using the R environment. The initial step was to streamline the dataset by retaining only the essential variables for textual and engagement analysis: text, likeCount, and reply.\nI utilized the R packages dplyr and stringr to focus on standardizing the text column. This involved a series of cleaning operations: normalization of whitespace (removing line breaks, tabs, and extra spaces, and trimming leading/trailing whitespace) and character filtering. Crucially, I removed non-essential symbols and unusual characters while meticulously preserving all Chinese characters to ensure the comments remained culturally authentic and meaningful for subsequent analysis.\nFinally, each cleaned and standardized dataset was saved as a new CSV file, appended with the suffix _cleaned. UTF-8 encoding was explicitly used to guarantee the accurate representation of the Chinese characters. This systematic workflow ensures the comment data are tidy, standardized, and immediately ready for downstream procedures, such as tokenization and sentiment or frequency analysis.\n\nsource(\"data_cleaning_CN.R\")\n\ndata cleaning complete!.\n\nSIMP001 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\n\n#Present the eample of the result\nhead(SIMP001)\n\n      videoId                  commentId parentId        author\n1 o5TfkwlthWU UgyekRC230MDXREkdeN4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @DanjonMeshi\n2 o5TfkwlthWU UgxangSP0zjJm6_gHfV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @paullee4451\n3 o5TfkwlthWU UgwZdLtl6Eb2wgDWaDV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;      @urikora\n4 o5TfkwlthWU UgwSmeqUyHYUXGD6l3l4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @fayechen1928\n5 o5TfkwlthWU UgwpotCAmJmn2wWU7u54AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @running_goat\n6 o5TfkwlthWU UgxQSyQbnLT9r7I1faB4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @Jack2006103\n                                                                                                                       text\n1                                                             商家集體給空袋真的笑死，不止生活在中國，連死在中國都要偷著樂😆\n2                                                                                                                      頭香\n3                       更慘的是，人都走了一個月 結果就在這時機點被抓來擋政府做的醜事（路崩華為車衝進去坑洞然後快速燃起來）\n4                                                                                      每次看到中國這種悲劇都覺得不可思議😨😭\n5 我真的必須得說對岸男女戰爭真的越來越嚴重== 問過好幾個對岸的女生都認為男生就是應該要給彩禮 吃飯就是要幫女生付錢等等 很可怕\n6                                                                                                這些店家吃人血饅頭，超噁爛\n  likeCount          publishedAt            updatedAt viewerRating canRate\n1        58 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z         none    TRUE\n2         0 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z         none    TRUE\n3       345 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z         none    TRUE\n4         1 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z         none    TRUE\n5       139 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z         none    TRUE\n6         4 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z         none    TRUE\n  reply\n1 FALSE\n2 FALSE\n3 FALSE\n4 FALSE\n5 FALSE\n6 FALSE\n\ndata1_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata2_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata3_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata4_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata5_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata6_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments_cleaned.csv\")"

First, a Word Cloud visualization (generated using the Word_cloud_visualization.R script) provided an intuitive, qualitative representation of high-frequency words, instantly highlighting the most common terms associated with discussions of “SIMP” behavior.\nSecond, I conducted a quantitative rank-frequency analysis by applying Zipf’s Law to the word corpus. After arranging all unique words by descending frequency and assigning a rank, I plotted the resulting distribution using the ggplot2 package. The resulting visualization confirmed that the comment discourse adheres to a Zipfian distribution, where a few words account for a disproportionate share of the total vocabulary.\nThe key terms driving the discourse were clearly identifiable:\nThese visualizations collectively offer both quantitative validation (Zipf’s Law distribution) and qualitative insight (Word Cloud/Top Terms) into how the audience discusses and perceives the central event and the related concept of “SIMP” behavior in this context.

Each word was repeated according to its frequency (total_count) to create co-occurrence information, which is essential for small datasets where natural co-occurrences are limited. The repeated words were then combined into a single space-separated pseudo-document and used to train a skip-gram Word2Vec model with a vector dimension of 50, window size of 5, and 50 iterations, setting min_count = 1 to include all words.\nThe resulting word vectors allow calculation of cosine similarity to examine semantic relationships between words, as well as clustering and downstream supervised learning tasks. For example, the vector for a keyword such as “為什麼” can be compared with all other word vectors to identify the top semantically similar words, revealing patterns in how concepts related to “SIMP” behavior are discussed in YouTube comments. This approach provides a robust representation of word meaning in the context of the dataset while accommodating the limited co-occurrence information inherent in smaller comment datasets.\n\n# Word2Vec can be the best option for the word embeding.\n\nsource(\"Word Embeddings.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'word2vec' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'text2vec' was built under R version 4.4.3"

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis\nFor sentiment analysis, I applied a custom Chinese sentiment dictionary tailored to the context of “SIMP” behavior. The dictionary categorizes words into three groups: positive (supportive or relationship-related words such as “女朋友” and “關心”), negative (critical or unfairness-related words such as “不值得” and “不公平”), and behavior (attention-seeking or “simp” behavior words such as “pua” and “追求”). Using R, I computed sentiment scores for each word in the dataset by summing occurrences in these categories. A raw polarity score was calculated as the sum of positive and behavior counts minus negative counts, then normalized by the total occurrences of all dictionary words to produce a relative polarity measure.\nThe analysis revealed that the current positive and negative categories do not fully capture the sentiment expressed in the comments. Some words were misclassified or contextually ambiguous, highlighting that the dictionary needs further adjustment and refinement to improve accuracy. Polarity distributions were visualized using a histogram, providing an overview of how positive, negative, and behavior-related language appears in discussions of “SIMP” behavior. This approach provides a preliminary sentiment assessment while acknowledging the limitations of the existing dictionary.\n\nsource(\"Sentiment Analysis.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ lubridate 1.9.4\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ NLP::annotate()         masks ggplot2::annotate()\n✖ httr::content()         masks NLP::content()\n✖ dplyr::filter()         masks stats::filter()\n✖ jsonlite::flatten()     masks purrr::flatten()\n✖ rvest::guess_encoding() masks readr::guess_encoding()\n✖ dplyr::lag()            masks stats::lag()\n✖ koRpus::tokenize()      masks readr::tokenize()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textmodels' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stopwords' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'stopwords'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nWarning: package 'caret' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\nAttaching package: 'caret'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:httr':\n\n    progress\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    lift\n\n\n[1] \"DFM after Custom Simp Dictionary Lookup (Counts per category):\"\n\n### SUPERVISED LEARNING (Naive Bayes Classification)\n[1] \"Confusion Matrix:\"\n\n### LEXICON-BASED NTUSD SENTIMENT RESULTS\n[1] \"Mean Sentiment Score by Simping Label (NTUSD):\"\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  contains_simp_factor mean_sentiment\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 FALSE                       -0.0990\n2 TRUE                        -0.477 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph:\nX-Axis: Simping Label:\n\nFALSE: Comments that do not contain any of the words from your custom “simp” dictionary (e.g., “舔狗,” “工具人,” “一廂情願,” etc.).\nTRUE: Comments that do contain at least one word from your custom “simp” dictionary.\n\nY-Axis: Comment Sentiment Score:\n\nPositive Scores (above 0): Indicate a more positive overall sentiment.\nZero (0): Indicates a neutral or balanced sentiment.\nNegative Scores (below 0): Indicate a more negative overall sentiment."

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis Summary\nThe lexicon-based sentiment analysis, utilizing the NTUSD dictionary, reveals a pronounced negative emotional shift in texts discussing the “simp” phenomenon. Specifically, content that contains terms from the custom dictionary—which targets themes like “simp behavior” (e.g., 舔狗, simp), “victim position” (e.g., 受害者, pua), and “relationship imbalance”—shows a highly negative mean sentiment score of -0.477. This score is significantly more negative than the average score of -0.0990 found in texts that do not contain these specific terms. This sharp difference (a nearly five-fold increase in negative sentiment magnitude) indicates that conversations about excessive one-sided effort, perceived exploitation, and unequal relationships—the core of the “simp” concept—are strongly associated with negative emotional discourse within the corpus."

The model achieved an overall Accuracy of 81.69%, which is slightly higher than the No Information Rate (NIR) of 80.36%, indicating its performance is marginally better than random guessing based on class prevalence.\nHowever, a closer look at the results reveals a significant class imbalance issue and skewed performance:\n\nHigh Sensitivity (Recall): The model is excellent at correctly identifying comments that do NOT contain the simp factor (the majority class, FALSE), with a high Sensitivity of 95.72%.\nLow Specificity: Conversely, the model is very poor at correctly identifying comments that DO contain the simp factor (the minority class, TRUE), with a low Specificity of 24.29%.\nKappa Value: The Kappa statistic of 0.2565 suggests only a fair level of agreement beyond chance.\n\nIn summary, the high overall accuracy is largely driven by correctly classifying the prevalent negative class (FALSE).

Crucially, it prunes the vocabulary by removing words that occur less than three times (term_count_min = 3), which helps reduce noise and improves the quality of the derived topics.\nDTM Creation: The processed tokens are converted into a Document-Term Matrix (DTM), which is the input required for LDA.\nModel Training: The script initializes and trains an LDA model with a predefined number of topics (K=8) and 500 iterations.\nOutput: Finally, the code extracts and saves two key results: the Topic-Word distribution (the top 10 most characteristic words for each of the 8 topics) and the

phenomenon with discussions about specific gender roles and identities within the Chinese context. The presence of “Not worth it” suggests this cluster is focused on evaluating the value of actions/relationships under the PUA framework.\nPUA & Gender Dynamics in China\n\n\nTopic 1\nThis topic mixes uncertainty and specific financial figures (Over 10k yuan), directly linked to PUA. It suggests discussions about high-stakes financial loss or investment by an individual in a relationship where the outcome or reality is unclear.\nFinancial Dimension of PUA & Uncertainty\n\n\nTopic 2\nThe simultaneous presence of “Victim,” “PUA,” and “Truly is” indicates a core discussion cluster dedicated to validating the existence and reality of being exploited. “McDonald’s” implies cheap/casual provision, while “Family’s” suggests the conversation may touch on the origins or impact of these dynamics within a family unit.\nValidating Victimhood & Low-Cost Exploitation\n\n\nTopic 3\nThis topic is saturated with questioning terms (“Is it?”, “Why?”, “Don’t know”), applied directly to boyfriend/girlfriend roles and the concept of gender equality. It represents a pervasive atmosphere of skepticism and critical discussion about expected behavior in modern relationships.\nSkepticism & Questioning of Relationship Roles\n\n\nTopic 4\nA highly polarized topic that denies (不可能, 不存在) the relevance or existence of Male Superiority (男尊女卑). It focuses on the possibility of being together (在一起), suggesting a desire for modern, equal partnerships and a strong rejection of patriarchal norms.\nDenial of Traditional Patriarchy in Relationships\n\n\nTopic 5\nTerms like “More and more” and “Majority” point to a discussion of social trends and scale. When combined with “Victim” and “Girlfriend,” it indicates a conversation about whether victimhood is becoming increasingly common or if the perception of victimhood is changing within the female partner role.\nDiscussing Shifting Social Norms & Victim Pool\n\n\nTopic 6\nThis is the most explicitly transactional topic. It discusses financial payment (RMB) and the concept of a person being reduced to a “Trash Can” (worthless/emotional dumping ground). The use of “And not” suggests a debate over what a relationship should be versus what it currently is (i.e., not a transaction, but one of money/exploitation).\nMonetary Value vs. Emotional Worth (The Price of Simping)\n\n\nTopic 7\nThis topic links resource provision (implied by “Buffet” and “Highway,” often used as metaphors for free/easy access) with discussions of Inequality and Gender Equality. It debates whether resources should be provided freely, who is responsible for providing them, and the resulting fairness in the relationship structure.\nResource Provision & Equality Debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTM\nTopic_Word_Rank\n\n\nV1\nTopic_0\n\n\nV2\nTopic_1\n\n\nV3\nTopic_2\n\n\nV4\nTopic_3\n\n\nV5\nTopic_4\n\n\nV6\nTopic_5\n\n\nV7\nTopic_6\n\n\nV8\nTopic_7"

    "text": "Causal Inference\nIn the casual inference part, I present the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to analyze how the probability of eight LDA topics influences the number of likes received by a comment (likeCount). Topic V8 (PUA/Victim) was set as the reference group (Reference Topic) in the model. Overall, the model’s explanatory power is extremely low (\\(\\text{Adjusted R-squared} = 0.00025\\)), suggesting that the variation in likeCount is primarily influenced by factors outside the model, rather than the topics themselves. However, the coefficient tests for individual topics revealed that Topic V2 demonstrated a statistically significant positive influence. After controlling for the effects of other topics, an increase of 1 unit in the probability of Topic V2 (Financial/Money II), relative to the reference group V8, is expected to increase the number of likes by approximately 9.66 (\\(p = 0.038^{*}\\)). This suggests that specific discussion content related to money or finance is more likely to garner attention and agreement within the community. Apart from the intercept, the remaining topics (V1, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7) did not show a statistically significant relationship with the number of likes.\n\nsource(\"Causal_Inference.R\")\n\nRows: 3006 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (9): doc_id, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n[1] \"--- OLS Regression Results (Outcome: likeCount) ---\"\n[1] \"Reference Topic: V8 (PUA/Victim)\"\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = likeCount ~ V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6 + V7, data = merged_df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n -18.59   -8.93   -6.76   -5.12 1763.41 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This specific form of critical discussion related to ‘SIMP’ behavior is extremely negative in sentiment (\\(\\text{mean}\\) \\(\\text{sentiment} = -0.477\\)) and is so unique in its linguistic pattern that its occurrence can be accurately predicted by the supervised learning model. Consequently, the community’s response to ‘SIMP’ behavior is highly concentrated and emotionally charged, with its online visibility predominantly stemming from comments that link the behavior directly to concrete financial inequality and victim scenarios.”"

    "section": "Future",
    "text": "Future\nFuture work should prioritize addressing the observed limitations in both the supervised classification model and the initial data preprocessing pipeline to enhance the robustness and explanatory power of the analysis. Firstly, while the initial Naive Bayes classifier provided baseline insights, its predictive performance should be critically re-evaluated. Improving the accuracy of the automated simp classification label requires exploring more sophisticated machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting, or even Transformer-based deep learning models. Concurrently, enhancing the feature set by refining or expanding the custom dictionaries—perhaps incorporating sentiment scores or incorporating word embeddings—could significantly boost the model’s ability to discriminate between classes, moving beyond simple bag-of-words approaches. Secondly, a crucial area for improvement lies in the token filtering and data processing stage. Despite standard removal procedures, the presence of numerous contextually irrelevant tokens, such as specific objects (“高速公路”) and brands (“麥當勞”), confirms the necessity of a more rigorous, domain-specific cleanup. Future efforts must focus on constructing an expanded, domain-aware stop word list or implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to systematically identify and remove non-topical, low-information tokens, ensuring the remaining features are highly predictive and representative of the core concepts being discussed."

    "text": "Data Collection\nTo explore the concept of “simping,” I collected YouTube comments from six relevant videos for textual analysis. I utilized an R scraping script to extract approximately 8,000 comments in total. Following a cleaning and filtering process, a dataset of around 7,000 practical comments was retained for analysis.\nI specifically focused on the case study known as the “胖貓跳江事件” (Suicide of Fat Cat). This event, which occurred in Mainland China, provides a particularly rich and relevant dataset because it was a well-documented news story officially reported by the Chinese court. This official documentation makes it a real and verifiable event, distinguishing it from mere rumors or social media anecdotes. Furthermore, the use of Chinese-language videos as the reference source is critical, as the Chinese-speaking audience possesses extensive background knowledge and cultural context directly related to the local details of this incident.\n\nSIMP001 - 陪打遊戲賺百萬養女友慘遭分手！「胖貓事件」引爆中國性別戰爭？「撈女」滿街跑的背後原因？【TODAY 看世界】(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TfkwlthWU&t=13s) 1952 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP002 - 当胖猫遇到捞女，一个年轻人如何走上不归路？｜女权｜捞女｜胖猫｜王者荣耀｜男女平权｜日本｜梅大高速｜舆论控制｜王局拍案20240507 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Gq_eOPuDY&t=1s) 3731 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP003 - 老梁：给“胖猫”多条选择 重庆“胖猫事件”不是性别大战 如何避免成为“胖猫”(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjcgg0wFpfE) 997 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP004 - 小伙為愛跳江，拜金的女友，吸血的親姐，無良的商家，瘋狂的網民，誰才是加害者？為何警察認定女友無罪，反而是親姐違了法？一口氣看完胖貓事件始末！| Wayne調查(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igs7GoIU4MU) 615 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP005 - 神級陪玩「胖貓」遭詐乾227萬亡 女友道歉｜20240506 ET午間新聞 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE83zZEcOY) 402 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP006 - 被撈女騙光50萬，遊戲宅男跳江自殺，轟動全網！撈女譚竹榨乾胖貓事件真相！『新闻最嘲点 姜光宇』2024.0508(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYngd2Yt3zk) 271 comments from 11/04/2025\n\n\nlibrary(plyr)\n\nWarning: package 'plyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise,\n    summarize\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nWarning: package 'tidytext' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'purrr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    compact\n\nlibrary(chromote)\n\nWarning: package 'chromote' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(stargazer)\n\n\nPlease cite as: \n\n\n Hlavac, Marek (2022). stargazer: Well-Formatted Regression and Summary Statistics Tables.\n\n\n R package version 5.2.3. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stargazer \n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\nWarning: package 'corrplot' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n\nlibrary(tm)\n\nWarning: package 'tm' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: NLP\n\n\nWarning: package 'NLP' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'NLP'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\nlibrary(wordcloud)\n\nWarning: package 'wordcloud' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: RColorBrewer\n\nlibrary(quanteda)\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nPackage version: 4.3.1\nUnicode version: 15.1\nICU version: 74.1\n\n\nParallel computing: 12 of 12 threads used.\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'quanteda'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    meta, meta&lt;-\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nWarning: package 'rvest' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textplots\")\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textplots' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr)\n\nWarning: package 'httr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'httr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    content\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(RedditExtractoR)\n\nWarning: package 'RedditExtractoR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nWarning: package 'httr2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments.csv\")\ndata3 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments.csv\")\ndata4 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments.csv\")\ndata5 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments.csv\")\ndata6 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments.csv\")"

The original structure included columns such as: videoId, commentId, parentId, author, text, likeCount, publishedAt, updatedAt, viewerRating, canRate, and reply.\nFor data cleaning, all CSV files in the Final_project_data folder were systematically processed using the R environment. The initial step was to streamline the dataset by retaining only the essential variables for textual and engagement analysis: text, likeCount, and reply.\nI utilized the R packages dplyr and stringr to focus on standardizing the text column. This involved a series of cleaning operations: normalization of whitespace (removing line breaks, tabs, and extra spaces, and trimming leading/trailing whitespace) and character filtering. Crucially, I removed non-essential symbols and unusual characters while meticulously preserving all Chinese characters to ensure the comments remained culturally authentic and meaningful for subsequent analysis.\nFinally, each cleaned and standardized dataset was saved as a new CSV file, appended with the suffix _cleaned. UTF-8 encoding was explicitly used to guarantee the accurate representation of the Chinese characters. This systematic workflow ensures the comment data are tidy, standardized, and immediately ready for downstream procedures, such as tokenization and sentiment or frequency analysis.\n\nsource(\"data_cleaning_CN.R\")\n\ndata cleaning complete!.\n\nSIMP001 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\n\n#Present the eample of the result\nhead(SIMP001)\n\n      videoId                  commentId parentId        author\n1 o5TfkwlthWU UgyekRC230MDXREkdeN4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @DanjonMeshi\n2 o5TfkwlthWU UgxangSP0zjJm6_gHfV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @paullee4451\n3 o5TfkwlthWU UgwZdLtl6Eb2wgDWaDV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;      @urikora\n4 o5TfkwlthWU UgwSmeqUyHYUXGD6l3l4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @fayechen1928\n5 o5TfkwlthWU UgwpotCAmJmn2wWU7u54AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @running_goat\n6 o5TfkwlthWU UgxQSyQbnLT9r7I1faB4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @Jack2006103\n                                                                                                                       text\n1                                                             商家集體給空袋真的笑死，不止生活在中國，連死在中國都要偷著樂😆\n2                                                                                                                      頭香\n3                       更慘的是，人都走了一個月 結果就在這時機點被抓來擋政府做的醜事（路崩華為車衝進去坑洞然後快速燃起來）\n4                                                                                      每次看到中國這種悲劇都覺得不可思議😨😭\n5 我真的必須得說對岸男女戰爭真的越來越嚴重== 問過好幾個對岸的女生都認為男生就是應該要給彩禮 吃飯就是要幫女生付錢等等 很可怕\n6                                                                                                這些店家吃人血饅頭，超噁爛\n  likeCount          publishedAt            updatedAt viewerRating canRate\n1        58 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z         none    TRUE\n2         0 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z         none    TRUE\n3       345 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z         none    TRUE\n4         1 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z         none    TRUE\n5       139 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z         none    TRUE\n6         4 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z         none    TRUE\n  reply\n1 FALSE\n2 FALSE\n3 FALSE\n4 FALSE\n5 FALSE\n6 FALSE\n\ndata1_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata2_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata3_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata4_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata5_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata6_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments_cleaned.csv\")"

First, a Word Cloud visualization (generated using the Word_cloud_visualization.R script) provided an intuitive, qualitative representation of high-frequency words, instantly highlighting the most common terms associated with discussions of “SIMP” behavior.\nSecond, I conducted a quantitative rank-frequency analysis by applying Zipf’s Law to the word corpus. After arranging all unique words by descending frequency and assigning a rank, I plotted the resulting distribution using the ggplot2 package. The resulting visualization confirmed that the comment discourse adheres to a Zipfian distribution, where a few words account for a disproportionate share of the total vocabulary.\nThe key terms driving the discourse were clearly identifiable:\nThese visualizations collectively offer both quantitative validation (Zipf’s Law distribution) and qualitative insight (Word Cloud/Top Terms) into how the audience discusses and perceives the central event and the related concept of “SIMP” behavior in this context.

Each word was repeated according to its frequency (total_count) to create co-occurrence information, which is essential for small datasets where natural co-occurrences are limited. The repeated words were then combined into a single space-separated pseudo-document and used to train a skip-gram Word2Vec model with a vector dimension of 50, window size of 5, and 50 iterations, setting min_count = 1 to include all words.\nThe resulting word vectors allow calculation of cosine similarity to examine semantic relationships between words, as well as clustering and downstream supervised learning tasks. For example, the vector for a keyword such as “為什麼” can be compared with all other word vectors to identify the top semantically similar words, revealing patterns in how concepts related to “SIMP” behavior are discussed in YouTube comments. This approach provides a robust representation of word meaning in the context of the dataset while accommodating the limited co-occurrence information inherent in smaller comment datasets.\n\n# Word2Vec can be the best option for the word embeding.\n\nsource(\"Word Embeddings.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'word2vec' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'text2vec' was built under R version 4.4.3"

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis\nFor sentiment analysis, I applied a custom Chinese sentiment dictionary tailored to the context of “SIMP” behavior. The dictionary categorizes words into three groups: positive (supportive or relationship-related words such as “女朋友” and “關心”), negative (critical or unfairness-related words such as “不值得” and “不公平”), and behavior (attention-seeking or “simp” behavior words such as “pua” and “追求”). Using R, I computed sentiment scores for each word in the dataset by summing occurrences in these categories. A raw polarity score was calculated as the sum of positive and behavior counts minus negative counts, then normalized by the total occurrences of all dictionary words to produce a relative polarity measure.\nThe analysis revealed that the current positive and negative categories do not fully capture the sentiment expressed in the comments. Some words were misclassified or contextually ambiguous, highlighting that the dictionary needs further adjustment and refinement to improve accuracy. Polarity distributions were visualized using a histogram, providing an overview of how positive, negative, and behavior-related language appears in discussions of “SIMP” behavior. This approach provides a preliminary sentiment assessment while acknowledging the limitations of the existing dictionary.\n\nsource(\"Sentiment Analysis.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ lubridate 1.9.4\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ NLP::annotate()         masks ggplot2::annotate()\n✖ httr::content()         masks NLP::content()\n✖ dplyr::filter()         masks stats::filter()\n✖ jsonlite::flatten()     masks purrr::flatten()\n✖ rvest::guess_encoding() masks readr::guess_encoding()\n✖ dplyr::lag()            masks stats::lag()\n✖ koRpus::tokenize()      masks readr::tokenize()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textmodels' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stopwords' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'stopwords'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nWarning: package 'caret' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\nAttaching package: 'caret'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:httr':\n\n    progress\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    lift\n\n\n[1] \"DFM after Custom Simp Dictionary Lookup (Counts per category):\"\n\n### SUPERVISED LEARNING (Naive Bayes Classification)\n[1] \"Confusion Matrix:\"\n\n### LEXICON-BASED NTUSD SENTIMENT RESULTS\n[1] \"Mean Sentiment Score by Simping Label (NTUSD):\"\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  contains_simp_factor mean_sentiment\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 FALSE                       -0.0990\n2 TRUE                        -0.477 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph:\nX-Axis: Simping Label:\n\nFALSE: Comments that do not contain any of the words from your custom “simp” dictionary (e.g., “舔狗,” “工具人,” “一廂情願,” etc.).\nTRUE: Comments that do contain at least one word from your custom “simp” dictionary.\n\nY-Axis: Comment Sentiment Score:\n\nPositive Scores (above 0): Indicate a more positive overall sentiment.\nZero (0): Indicates a neutral or balanced sentiment.\nNegative Scores (below 0): Indicate a more negative overall sentiment."

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis Summary\nThe lexicon-based sentiment analysis, utilizing the NTUSD dictionary, reveals a pronounced negative emotional shift in texts discussing the “simp” phenomenon. Specifically, content that contains terms from the custom dictionary—which targets themes like “simp behavior” (e.g., 舔狗, simp), “victim position” (e.g., 受害者, pua), and “relationship imbalance”—shows a highly negative mean sentiment score of -0.477. This score is significantly more negative than the average score of -0.0990 found in texts that do not contain these specific terms. This sharp difference (a nearly five-fold increase in negative sentiment magnitude) indicates that conversations about excessive one-sided effort, perceived exploitation, and unequal relationships—the core of the “simp” concept—are strongly associated with negative emotional discourse within the corpus."

    "text": "Supervised Learning Analysis (Naive Bayes Classification)\nThe Naive Bayes model was employed to classify comments based on whether they contained the “simp” factor, using a cleaned feature set that excluded all words from the custom “simp” dictionary to prevent data leakage. The model achieved an overall Accuracy of 81.69%, which is slightly higher than the No Information Rate (NIR) of 80.36%, indicating its performance is marginally better than random guessing based on class prevalence.\nHowever, a closer look at the results reveals a significant class imbalance issue and skewed performance:\n\nHigh Sensitivity (Recall): The model is excellent at correctly identifying comments that do NOT contain the simp factor (the majority class, FALSE), with a high Sensitivity of 95.72%.\nLow Specificity: Conversely, the model is very poor at correctly identifying comments that DO contain the simp factor (the minority class, TRUE), with a low Specificity of 24.29%.\nKappa Value: The Kappa statistic of 0.2565 suggests only a fair level of agreement beyond chance.\n\nIn summary, the high overall accuracy is largely driven by correctly classifying the prevalent negative class (FALSE). The model struggles to reliably identify actual “simp” comments (TRUE), suggesting that the remaining general vocabulary in the comments lacks sufficient predictive power to consistently distinguish between the two categories without the core dictionary terms.\n\nsource(\"Supervised_Learning.R\")\n\n\n--- Solving Data Leakage: Remove the word which exist in Simp dictionary ---\n[1] \"Original (matrix_main): 2703\"\n[1] \"Remove the word in Simp dictionary (X_cleaned): 2674\"\n\n--- 6.

Crucially, it prunes the vocabulary by removing words that occur less than three times (term_count_min = 3), which helps reduce noise and improves the quality of the derived topics.\nDTM Creation: The processed tokens are converted into a Document-Term Matrix (DTM), which is the input required for LDA.\nModel Training: The script initializes and trains an LDA model with a predefined number of topics (K=8) and 500 iterations.\nOutput: Finally, the code extracts and saves two key results: the Topic-Word distribution (the top 10 most characteristic words for each of the 8 topics) and the Document-Topic distribution (the probability that each comment belongs to each topic), storing both as CSV files for subsequent qualitative analysis.\n\n\nsource(\"Topic_Model.R\")\n\n[1] \"Starting

phenomenon with discussions about specific gender roles and identities within the Chinese context. The presence of “Not worth it” suggests this cluster is focused on evaluating the value of actions/relationships under the PUA framework.\nPUA & Gender Dynamics in China\n\n\nTopic 1\nThis topic mixes uncertainty and specific financial figures (Over 10k yuan), directly linked to PUA. It suggests discussions about high-stakes financial loss or investment by an individual in a relationship where the outcome or reality is unclear.\nFinancial Dimension of PUA & Uncertainty\n\n\nTopic 2\nThe simultaneous presence of “Victim,” “PUA,” and “Truly is” indicates a core discussion cluster dedicated to validating the existence and reality of being exploited. “McDonald’s” implies cheap/casual provision, while “Family’s” suggests the conversation may touch on the origins or impact of these dynamics within a family unit.\nValidating Victimhood & Low-Cost Exploitation\n\n\nTopic 3\nThis topic is saturated with questioning terms (“Is it?”, “Why?”, “Don’t know”), applied directly to boyfriend/girlfriend roles and the concept of gender equality. It represents a pervasive atmosphere of skepticism and critical discussion about expected behavior in modern relationships.\nSkepticism & Questioning of Relationship Roles\n\n\nTopic 4\nA highly polarized topic that denies (不可能, 不存在) the relevance or existence of Male Superiority (男尊女卑). It focuses on the possibility of being together (在一起), suggesting a desire for modern, equal partnerships and a strong rejection of patriarchal norms.\nDenial of Traditional Patriarchy in Relationships\n\n\nTopic 5\nTerms like “More and more” and “Majority” point to a discussion of social trends and scale. When combined with “Victim” and “Girlfriend,” it indicates a conversation about whether victimhood is becoming increasingly common or if the perception of victimhood is changing within the female partner role.\nDiscussing Shifting Social Norms & Victim Pool\n\n\nTopic 6\nThis is the most explicitly transactional topic. It discusses financial payment (RMB) and the concept of a person being reduced to a “Trash Can” (worthless/emotional dumping ground). The use of “And not” suggests a debate over what a relationship should be versus what it currently is (i.e., not a transaction, but one of money/exploitation).\nMonetary Value vs. Emotional Worth (The Price of Simping)\n\n\nTopic 7\nThis topic links resource provision (implied by “Buffet” and “Highway,” often used as metaphors for free/easy access) with discussions of Inequality and Gender Equality. It debates whether resources should be provided freely, who is responsible for providing them, and the resulting fairness in the relationship structure.\nResource Provision & Equality Debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTM\nTopic_Word_Rank\n\n\nV1\nTopic_0\n\n\nV2\nTopic_1\n\n\nV3\nTopic_2\n\n\nV4\nTopic_3\n\n\nV5\nTopic_4\n\n\nV6\nTopic_5\n\n\nV7\nTopic_6\n\n\nV8\nTopic_7"

    "text": "Causal Inference\nIn the casual inference part, I present the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to analyze how the probability of eight LDA topics influences the number of likes received by a comment (likeCount). Topic V8 (PUA/Victim) was set as the reference group (Reference Topic) in the model. Overall, the model’s explanatory power is extremely low (\\(\\text{Adjusted R-squared} = 0.00025\\)), suggesting that the variation in likeCount is primarily influenced by factors outside the model, rather than the topics themselves. However, the coefficient tests for individual topics revealed that Topic V2 demonstrated a statistically significant positive influence. After controlling for the effects of other topics, an increase of 1 unit in the probability of Topic V2 (Financial/Money II), relative to the reference group V8, is expected to increase the number of likes by approximately 9.66 (\\(p = 0.038^{*}\\)). This suggests that specific discussion content related to money or finance is more likely to garner attention and agreement within the community. Apart from the intercept, the remaining topics (V1, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7) did not show a statistically significant relationship with the number of likes.\n\nsource(\"Causal_Inference.R\")\n\nRows: 3006 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (9): doc_id, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n[1] \"--- OLS Regression Results (Outcome: likeCount) ---\"\n[1] \"Reference Topic: V8 (PUA/Victim)\"\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = likeCount ~ V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6 + V7, data = merged_df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n -18.59   -8.93   -6.76   -5.12 1763.41 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This specific form of critical discussion related to ‘SIMP’ behavior is extremely negative in sentiment (\\(\\text{mean}\\) \\(\\text{sentiment} = -0.477\\)) and is so unique in its linguistic pattern that its occurrence can be accurately predicted by the supervised learning model. Consequently, the community’s response to ‘SIMP’ behavior is highly concentrated and emotionally charged, with its online visibility predominantly stemming from comments that link the behavior directly to concrete financial inequality and victim scenarios.”"

    "section": "Future",
    "text": "Future\nFuture work should prioritize addressing the observed limitations in both the supervised classification model and the initial data preprocessing pipeline to enhance the robustness and explanatory power of the analysis. Firstly, while the initial Naive Bayes classifier provided baseline insights, its predictive performance should be critically re-evaluated. Improving the accuracy of the automated simp classification label requires exploring more sophisticated machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting, or even Transformer-based deep learning models. Concurrently, enhancing the feature set by refining or expanding the custom dictionaries—perhaps incorporating sentiment scores or incorporating word embeddings—could significantly boost the model’s ability to discriminate between classes, moving beyond simple bag-of-words approaches. Secondly, a crucial area for improvement lies in the token filtering and data processing stage. Despite standard removal procedures, the presence of numerous contextually irrelevant tokens, such as specific objects (“高速公路”) and brands (“麥當勞”), confirms the necessity of a more rigorous, domain-specific cleanup. Future efforts must focus on constructing an expanded, domain-aware stop word list or implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to systematically identify and remove non-topical, low-information tokens, ensuring the remaining features are highly predictive and representative of the core concepts being discussed."

    "text": "Data Collection\nTo explore the concept of “simping,” I collected YouTube comments from six relevant videos for textual analysis. I utilized an R scraping script to extract approximately 8,000 comments in total. Following a cleaning and filtering process, a dataset of around 7,000 practical comments was retained for analysis.\nI specifically focused on the case study known as the “胖貓跳江事件” (Suicide of Fat Cat). This event, which occurred in Mainland China, provides a particularly rich and relevant dataset because it was a well-documented news story officially reported by the Chinese court. This official documentation makes it a real and verifiable event, distinguishing it from mere rumors or social media anecdotes. Furthermore, the use of Chinese-language videos as the reference source is critical, as the Chinese-speaking audience possesses extensive background knowledge and cultural context directly related to the local details of this incident.\n\nSIMP001 - 陪打遊戲賺百萬養女友慘遭分手！「胖貓事件」引爆中國性別戰爭？「撈女」滿街跑的背後原因？【TODAY 看世界】(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TfkwlthWU&t=13s) 1952 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP002 - 当胖猫遇到捞女，一个年轻人如何走上不归路？｜女权｜捞女｜胖猫｜王者荣耀｜男女平权｜日本｜梅大高速｜舆论控制｜王局拍案20240507 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Gq_eOPuDY&t=1s) 3731 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP003 - 老梁：给“胖猫”多条选择 重庆“胖猫事件”不是性别大战 如何避免成为“胖猫”(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjcgg0wFpfE) 997 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP004 - 小伙為愛跳江，拜金的女友，吸血的親姐，無良的商家，瘋狂的網民，誰才是加害者？為何警察認定女友無罪，反而是親姐違了法？一口氣看完胖貓事件始末！| Wayne調查(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igs7GoIU4MU) 615 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP005 - 神級陪玩「胖貓」遭詐乾227萬亡 女友道歉｜20240506 ET午間新聞 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE83zZEcOY) 402 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP006 - 被撈女騙光50萬，遊戲宅男跳江自殺，轟動全網！撈女譚竹榨乾胖貓事件真相！『新闻最嘲点 姜光宇』2024.0508(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYngd2Yt3zk) 271 comments from 11/04/2025\n\n\nlibrary(plyr)\n\nWarning: package 'plyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise,\n    summarize\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nWarning: package 'tidytext' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'purrr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    compact\n\nlibrary(chromote)\n\nWarning: package 'chromote' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(stargazer)\n\n\nPlease cite as: \n\n\n Hlavac, Marek (2022). stargazer: Well-Formatted Regression and Summary Statistics Tables.\n\n\n R package version 5.2.3. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stargazer \n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\nWarning: package 'corrplot' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n\nlibrary(tm)\n\nWarning: package 'tm' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: NLP\n\n\nWarning: package 'NLP' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'NLP'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\nlibrary(wordcloud)\n\nWarning: package 'wordcloud' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: RColorBrewer\n\nlibrary(quanteda)\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nPackage version: 4.3.1\nUnicode version: 15.1\nICU version: 74.1\n\n\nParallel computing: 12 of 12 threads used.\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'quanteda'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    meta, meta&lt;-\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nWarning: package 'rvest' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textplots\")\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textplots' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr)\n\nWarning: package 'httr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'httr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    content\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(RedditExtractoR)\n\nWarning: package 'RedditExtractoR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nWarning: package 'httr2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments.csv\")\ndata3 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments.csv\")\ndata4 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments.csv\")\ndata5 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments.csv\")\ndata6 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments.csv\")"

The original structure included columns such as: videoId, commentId, parentId, author, text, likeCount, publishedAt, updatedAt, viewerRating, canRate, and reply.\nFor data cleaning, all CSV files in the Final_project_data folder were systematically processed using the R environment. The initial step was to streamline the dataset by retaining only the essential variables for textual and engagement analysis: text, likeCount, and reply.\nI utilized the R packages dplyr and stringr to focus on standardizing the text column. This involved a series of cleaning operations: normalization of whitespace (removing line breaks, tabs, and extra spaces, and trimming leading/trailing whitespace) and character filtering. Crucially, I removed non-essential symbols and unusual characters while meticulously preserving all Chinese characters to ensure the comments remained culturally authentic and meaningful for subsequent analysis.\nFinally, each cleaned and standardized dataset was saved as a new CSV file, appended with the suffix _cleaned. UTF-8 encoding was explicitly used to guarantee the accurate representation of the Chinese characters. This systematic workflow ensures the comment data are tidy, standardized, and immediately ready for downstream procedures, such as tokenization and sentiment or frequency analysis.\n\nsource(\"data_cleaning_CN.R\")\n\ndata cleaning complete!.\n\nSIMP001 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\n\n#Present the eample of the result\nhead(SIMP001)\n\n      videoId                  commentId parentId        author\n1 o5TfkwlthWU UgyekRC230MDXREkdeN4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @DanjonMeshi\n2 o5TfkwlthWU UgxangSP0zjJm6_gHfV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @paullee4451\n3 o5TfkwlthWU UgwZdLtl6Eb2wgDWaDV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;      @urikora\n4 o5TfkwlthWU UgwSmeqUyHYUXGD6l3l4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @fayechen1928\n5 o5TfkwlthWU UgwpotCAmJmn2wWU7u54AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @running_goat\n6 o5TfkwlthWU UgxQSyQbnLT9r7I1faB4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @Jack2006103\n                                                                                                                       text\n1                                                             商家集體給空袋真的笑死，不止生活在中國，連死在中國都要偷著樂😆\n2                                                                                                                      頭香\n3                       更慘的是，人都走了一個月 結果就在這時機點被抓來擋政府做的醜事（路崩華為車衝進去坑洞然後快速燃起來）\n4                                                                                      每次看到中國這種悲劇都覺得不可思議😨😭\n5 我真的必須得說對岸男女戰爭真的越來越嚴重== 問過好幾個對岸的女生都認為男生就是應該要給彩禮 吃飯就是要幫女生付錢等等 很可怕\n6                                                                                                這些店家吃人血饅頭，超噁爛\n  likeCount          publishedAt            updatedAt viewerRating canRate\n1        58 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z         none    TRUE\n2         0 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z         none    TRUE\n3       345 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z         none    TRUE\n4         1 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z         none    TRUE\n5       139 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z         none    TRUE\n6         4 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z         none    TRUE\n  reply\n1 FALSE\n2 FALSE\n3 FALSE\n4 FALSE\n5 FALSE\n6 FALSE\n\ndata1_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata2_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata3_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata4_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata5_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata6_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments_cleaned.csv\")"

First, a Word Cloud visualization (generated using the Word_cloud_visualization.R script) provided an intuitive, qualitative representation of high-frequency words, instantly highlighting the most common terms associated with discussions of “SIMP” behavior.\nSecond, I conducted a quantitative rank-frequency analysis by applying Zipf’s Law to the word corpus. After arranging all unique words by descending frequency and assigning a rank, I plotted the resulting distribution using the ggplot2 package. The resulting visualization confirmed that the comment discourse adheres to a Zipfian distribution, where a few words account for a disproportionate share of the total vocabulary.\nThe key terms driving the discourse were clearly identifiable:\nThese visualizations collectively offer both quantitative validation (Zipf’s Law distribution) and qualitative insight (Word Cloud/Top Terms) into how the audience discusses and perceives the central event and the related concept of “SIMP” behavior in this context.

Each word was repeated according to its frequency (total_count) to create co-occurrence information, which is essential for small datasets where natural co-occurrences are limited. The repeated words were then combined into a single space-separated pseudo-document and used to train a skip-gram Word2Vec model with a vector dimension of 50, window size of 5, and 50 iterations, setting min_count = 1 to include all words.\nThe resulting word vectors allow calculation of cosine similarity to examine semantic relationships between words, as well as clustering and downstream supervised learning tasks. For example, the vector for a keyword such as “為什麼” can be compared with all other word vectors to identify the top semantically similar words, revealing patterns in how concepts related to “SIMP” behavior are discussed in YouTube comments.

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis\nFor sentiment analysis, I applied a custom Chinese sentiment dictionary tailored to the context of “SIMP” behavior. The dictionary categorizes words into three groups: positive (supportive or relationship-related words such as “女朋友” and “關心”), negative (critical or unfairness-related words such as “不值得” and “不公平”), and behavior (attention-seeking or “simp” behavior words such as “pua” and “追求”). Using R, I computed sentiment scores for each word in the dataset by summing occurrences in these categories. A raw polarity score was calculated as the sum of positive and behavior counts minus negative counts, then normalized by the total occurrences of all dictionary words to produce a relative polarity measure.\nThe analysis revealed that the current positive and negative categories do not fully capture the sentiment expressed in the comments. Some words were misclassified or contextually ambiguous, highlighting that the dictionary needs further adjustment and refinement to improve accuracy. Polarity distributions were visualized using a histogram, providing an overview of how positive, negative, and behavior-related language appears in discussions of “SIMP” behavior. This approach provides a preliminary sentiment assessment while acknowledging the limitations of the existing dictionary.\n\nsource(\"Sentiment Analysis.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ lubridate 1.9.4\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ NLP::annotate()         masks ggplot2::annotate()\n✖ httr::content()         masks NLP::content()\n✖ dplyr::filter()         masks stats::filter()\n✖ jsonlite::flatten()     masks purrr::flatten()\n✖ rvest::guess_encoding() masks readr::guess_encoding()\n✖ dplyr::lag()            masks stats::lag()\n✖ koRpus::tokenize()      masks readr::tokenize()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textmodels' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stopwords' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'stopwords'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nWarning: package 'caret' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\nAttaching package: 'caret'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:httr':\n\n    progress\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    lift\n\n\n[1] \"DFM after Custom Simp Dictionary Lookup (Counts per category):\"\n\n### SUPERVISED LEARNING (Naive Bayes Classification)\n[1] \"Confusion Matrix:\"\n\n### LEXICON-BASED NTUSD SENTIMENT RESULTS\n[1] \"Mean Sentiment Score by Simping Label (NTUSD):\"\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  contains_simp_factor mean_sentiment\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 FALSE                       -0.0990\n2 TRUE                        -0.477 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph:\nX-Axis: Simping Label:\n\nFALSE: Comments that do not contain any of the words from your custom “simp” dictionary (e.g., “舔狗,” “工具人,” “一廂情願,” etc.).\nTRUE: Comments that do contain at least one word from your custom “simp” dictionary.\n\nY-Axis: Comment Sentiment Score:\n\nPositive Scores (above 0): Indicate a more positive overall sentiment.\nZero (0): Indicates a neutral or balanced sentiment.\nNegative Scores (below 0): Indicate a more negative overall sentiment."

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis Summary\nThe lexicon-based sentiment analysis, utilizing the NTUSD dictionary, reveals a pronounced negative emotional shift in texts discussing the “simp” phenomenon. Specifically, content that contains terms from the custom dictionary—which targets themes like “simp behavior” (e.g., 舔狗, simp), “victim position” (e.g., 受害者, pua), and “relationship imbalance”—shows a highly negative mean sentiment score of -0.477. This score is significantly more negative than the average score of -0.0990 found in texts that do not contain these specific terms. This sharp difference (a nearly five-fold increase in negative sentiment magnitude) indicates that conversations about excessive one-sided effort, perceived exploitation, and unequal relationships—the core of the “simp” concept—are strongly associated with negative emotional discourse within the corpus."

    "text": "Supervised Learning Analysis (Naive Bayes Classification)\nThe Naive Bayes model was employed to classify comments based on whether they contained the “simp” factor, using a cleaned feature set that excluded all words from the custom “simp” dictionary to prevent data leakage. The model achieved an overall Accuracy of 81.69%, which is slightly higher than the No Information Rate (NIR) of 80.36%, indicating its performance is marginally better than random guessing based on class prevalence.\nHowever, a closer look at the results reveals a significant class imbalance issue and skewed performance:\n\nHigh Sensitivity (Recall): The model is excellent at correctly identifying comments that do NOT contain the simp factor (the majority class, FALSE), with a high Sensitivity of 95.72%.\nLow Specificity: Conversely, the model is very poor at correctly identifying comments that DO contain the simp factor (the minority class, TRUE), with a low Specificity of 24.29%.\nKappa Value: The Kappa statistic of 0.2565 suggests only a fair level of agreement beyond chance.\n\nIn summary, the high overall accuracy is largely driven by correctly classifying the prevalent negative class (FALSE). The model struggles to reliably identify actual “simp” comments (TRUE), suggesting that the remaining general vocabulary in the comments lacks sufficient predictive power to consistently distinguish between the two categories without the core dictionary terms.\n\nsource(\"Supervised_Learning.R\")\n\n\n--- Solving Data Leakage: Remove the word which exist in Simp dictionary ---\n[1] \"Original (matrix_main): 2703\"\n[1] \"Remove the word in Simp dictionary (X_cleaned): 2674\"\n\n--- 6.

Crucially, it prunes the vocabulary by removing words that occur less than three times (term_count_min = 3), which helps reduce noise and improves the quality of the derived topics.\nDTM Creation: The processed tokens are converted into a Document-Term Matrix (DTM), which is the input required for LDA.\nModel Training: The script initializes and trains an LDA model with a predefined number of topics (K=8) and 500 iterations.\nOutput: Finally, the code extracts and saves two key results: the Topic-Word distribution (the top 10 most characteristic words for each of the 8 topics) and the Document-Topic distribution (the probability that each comment belongs to each topic), storing both as CSV files for subsequent qualitative analysis.\n\n\nsource(\"Topic_Model.R\")\n\n[1] \"Starting

phenomenon with discussions about specific gender roles and identities within the Chinese context. The presence of “Not worth it” suggests this cluster is focused on evaluating the value of actions/relationships under the PUA framework.\nPUA & Gender Dynamics in China\n\n\nTopic 1\nThis topic mixes uncertainty and specific financial figures (Over 10k yuan), directly linked to PUA. It suggests discussions about high-stakes financial loss or investment by an individual in a relationship where the outcome or reality is unclear.\nFinancial Dimension of PUA & Uncertainty\n\n\nTopic 2\nThe simultaneous presence of “Victim,” “PUA,” and “Truly is” indicates a core discussion cluster dedicated to validating the existence and reality of being exploited. “McDonald’s” implies cheap/casual provision, while “Family’s” suggests the conversation may touch on the origins or impact of these dynamics within a family unit.\nValidating Victimhood & Low-Cost Exploitation\n\n\nTopic 3\nThis topic is saturated with questioning terms (“Is it?”, “Why?”, “Don’t know”), applied directly to boyfriend/girlfriend roles and the concept of gender equality. It represents a pervasive atmosphere of skepticism and critical discussion about expected behavior in modern relationships.\nSkepticism & Questioning of Relationship Roles\n\n\nTopic 4\nA highly polarized topic that denies (不可能, 不存在) the relevance or existence of Male Superiority (男尊女卑). It focuses on the possibility of being together (在一起), suggesting a desire for modern, equal partnerships and a strong rejection of patriarchal norms.\nDenial of Traditional Patriarchy in Relationships\n\n\nTopic 5\nTerms like “More and more” and “Majority” point to a discussion of social trends and scale. When combined with “Victim” and “Girlfriend,” it indicates a conversation about whether victimhood is becoming increasingly common or if the perception of victimhood is changing within the female partner role.\nDiscussing Shifting Social Norms & Victim Pool\n\n\nTopic 6\nThis is the most explicitly transactional topic. It discusses financial payment (RMB) and the concept of a person being reduced to a “Trash Can” (worthless/emotional dumping ground). The use of “And not” suggests a debate over what a relationship should be versus what it currently is (i.e., not a transaction, but one of money/exploitation).\nMonetary Value vs. Emotional Worth (The Price of Simping)\n\n\nTopic 7\nThis topic links resource provision (implied by “Buffet” and “Highway,” often used as metaphors for free/easy access) with discussions of Inequality and Gender Equality. It debates whether resources should be provided freely, who is responsible for providing them, and the resulting fairness in the relationship structure.\nResource Provision & Equality Debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTM\nTopic_Word_Rank\n\n\nV1\nTopic_0\n\n\nV2\nTopic_1\n\n\nV3\nTopic_2\n\n\nV4\nTopic_3\n\n\nV5\nTopic_4\n\n\nV6\nTopic_5\n\n\nV7\nTopic_6\n\n\nV8\nTopic_7"

    "text": "Causal Inference\nIn the casual inference part, I present the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to analyze how the probability of eight LDA topics influences the number of likes received by a comment (likeCount). Topic V8 (PUA/Victim) was set as the reference group (Reference Topic) in the model. Overall, the model’s explanatory power is extremely low (\\(\\text{Adjusted R-squared} = 0.00025\\)), suggesting that the variation in likeCount is primarily influenced by factors outside the model, rather than the topics themselves. However, the coefficient tests for individual topics revealed that Topic V2 demonstrated a statistically significant positive influence. After controlling for the effects of other topics, an increase of 1 unit in the probability of Topic V2 (Financial/Money II), relative to the reference group V8, is expected to increase the number of likes by approximately 9.66 (\\(p = 0.038^{*}\\)). This suggests that specific discussion content related to money or finance is more likely to garner attention and agreement within the community. Apart from the intercept, the remaining topics (V1, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7) did not show a statistically significant relationship with the number of likes.\n\nsource(\"Causal_Inference.R\")\n\nRows: 3006 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (9): doc_id, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n[1] \"--- OLS Regression Results (Outcome: likeCount) ---\"\n[1] \"Reference Topic: V8 (PUA/Victim)\"\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = likeCount ~ V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6 + V7, data = merged_df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n -18.59   -8.93   -6.76   -5.12 1763.41 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This specific form of critical discussion related to ‘SIMP’ behavior is extremely negative in sentiment (\\(\\text{mean}\\) \\(\\text{sentiment} = -0.477\\)) and is so unique in its linguistic pattern that its occurrence can be accurately predicted by the supervised learning model. Consequently, the community’s response to ‘SIMP’ behavior is highly concentrated and emotionally charged, with its online visibility predominantly stemming from comments that link the behavior directly to concrete financial inequality and victim scenarios.”"

    "section": "Future",
    "text": "Future\nFuture work should prioritize addressing the observed limitations in both the supervised classification model and the initial data preprocessing pipeline to enhance the robustness and explanatory power of the analysis. Firstly, while the initial Naive Bayes classifier provided baseline insights, its predictive performance should be critically re-evaluated. Improving the accuracy of the automated simp classification label requires exploring more sophisticated machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting, or even Transformer-based deep learning models. Concurrently, enhancing the feature set by refining or expanding the custom dictionaries—perhaps incorporating sentiment scores or incorporating word embeddings—could significantly boost the model’s ability to discriminate between classes, moving beyond simple bag-of-words approaches. Secondly, a crucial area for improvement lies in the token filtering and data processing stage. Despite standard removal procedures, the presence of numerous contextually irrelevant tokens, such as specific objects (“高速公路”) and brands (“麥當勞”), confirms the necessity of a more rigorous, domain-specific cleanup. Future efforts must focus on constructing an expanded, domain-aware stop word list or implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to systematically identify and remove non-topical, low-information tokens, ensuring the remaining features are highly predictive and representative of the core concepts being discussed."

I utilized an R scraping script to extract approximately 8,000 comments in total. Following a cleaning and filtering process, a dataset of around 7,000 practical comments was retained for analysis.\nI specifically focused on the case study known as the “胖貓跳江事件” (Suicide of Fat Cat). This event, which occurred in Mainland China, provides a particularly rich and relevant dataset because it was a well-documented news story officially reported by the Chinese court. This official documentation makes it a real and verifiable event, distinguishing it from mere rumors or social media anecdotes. Furthermore, the use of Chinese-language videos as the reference source is critical, as the Chinese-speaking audience possesses extensive background knowledge and cultural context directly related to the local details of this incident.\n\nSIMP001 - 陪打遊戲賺百萬養女友慘遭分手！「胖貓事件」引爆中國性別戰爭？「撈女」滿街跑的背後原因？【TODAY 看世界】(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TfkwlthWU&t=13s) 1952 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP002 - 当胖猫遇到捞女，一个年轻人如何走上不归路？｜女权｜捞女｜胖猫｜王者荣耀｜男女平权｜日本｜梅大高速｜舆论控制｜王局拍案20240507 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Gq_eOPuDY&t=1s) 3731 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP003 - 老梁：给“胖猫”多条选择 重庆“胖猫事件”不是性别大战 如何避免成为“胖猫”(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjcgg0wFpfE) 997 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP004 - 小伙為愛跳江，拜金的女友，吸血的親姐，無良的商家，瘋狂的網民，誰才是加害者？為何警察認定女友無罪，反而是親姐違了法？一口氣看完胖貓事件始末！| Wayne調查(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igs7GoIU4MU) 615 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP005 - 神級陪玩「胖貓」遭詐乾227萬亡 女友道歉｜20240506 ET午間新聞 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE83zZEcOY) 402 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP006 - 被撈女騙光50萬，遊戲宅男跳江自殺，轟動全網！撈女譚竹榨乾胖貓事件真相！『新闻最嘲点 姜光宇』2024.0508(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYngd2Yt3zk) 271 comments from 11/04/2025\n\n\nlibrary(plyr)\n\nWarning: package 'plyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise,\n    summarize\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nWarning: package 'tidytext' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'purrr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    compact\n\nlibrary(chromote)\n\nWarning: package 'chromote' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(stargazer)\n\n\nPlease cite as: \n\n\n Hlavac, Marek (2022). stargazer: Well-Formatted Regression and Summary Statistics Tables.\n\n\n R package version 5.2.3. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stargazer \n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\nWarning: package 'corrplot' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n\nlibrary(tm)\n\nWarning: package 'tm' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: NLP\n\n\nWarning: package 'NLP' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'NLP'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\nlibrary(wordcloud)\n\nWarning: package 'wordcloud' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: RColorBrewer\n\nlibrary(quanteda)\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nPackage version: 4.3.1\nUnicode version: 15.1\nICU version: 74.1\n\n\nParallel computing: 12 of 12 threads used.\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'quanteda'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    meta, meta&lt;-\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nWarning: package 'rvest' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textplots\")\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textplots' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr)\n\nWarning: package 'httr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'httr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    content\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(RedditExtractoR)\n\nWarning: package 'RedditExtractoR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nWarning: package 'httr2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments.csv\")\ndata3 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments.csv\")\ndata4 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments.csv\")\ndata5 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments.csv\")\ndata6 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments.csv\")"

The original structure included columns such as: videoId, commentId, parentId, author, text, likeCount, publishedAt, updatedAt, viewerRating, canRate, and reply.\nFor data cleaning, all CSV files in the Final_project_data folder were systematically processed using the R environment. The initial step was to streamline the dataset by retaining only the essential variables for textual and engagement analysis: text, likeCount, and reply.\nI utilized the R packages dplyr and stringr to focus on standardizing the text column. This involved a series of cleaning operations: normalization of whitespace (removing line breaks, tabs, and extra spaces, and trimming leading/trailing whitespace) and character filtering. Crucially, I removed non-essential symbols and unusual characters while meticulously preserving all Chinese characters to ensure the comments remained culturally authentic and meaningful for subsequent analysis.\nFinally, each cleaned and standardized dataset was saved as a new CSV file, appended with the suffix _cleaned. UTF-8 encoding was explicitly used to guarantee the accurate representation of the Chinese characters. This systematic workflow ensures the comment data are tidy, standardized, and immediately ready for downstream procedures, such as tokenization and sentiment or frequency analysis.\n\nsource(\"data_cleaning_CN.R\")\n\ndata cleaning complete!.\n\nSIMP001 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\n\n#Present the eample of the result\nhead(SIMP001)\n\n      videoId                  commentId parentId        author\n1 o5TfkwlthWU UgyekRC230MDXREkdeN4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @DanjonMeshi\n2 o5TfkwlthWU UgxangSP0zjJm6_gHfV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @paullee4451\n3 o5TfkwlthWU UgwZdLtl6Eb2wgDWaDV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;      @urikora\n4 o5TfkwlthWU UgwSmeqUyHYUXGD6l3l4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @fayechen1928\n5 o5TfkwlthWU UgwpotCAmJmn2wWU7u54AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @running_goat\n6 o5TfkwlthWU UgxQSyQbnLT9r7I1faB4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @Jack2006103\n                                                                                                                       text\n1                                                             商家集體給空袋真的笑死，不止生活在中國，連死在中國都要偷著樂😆\n2                                                                                                                      頭香\n3                       更慘的是，人都走了一個月 結果就在這時機點被抓來擋政府做的醜事（路崩華為車衝進去坑洞然後快速燃起來）\n4                                                                                      每次看到中國這種悲劇都覺得不可思議😨😭\n5 我真的必須得說對岸男女戰爭真的越來越嚴重== 問過好幾個對岸的女生都認為男生就是應該要給彩禮 吃飯就是要幫女生付錢等等 很可怕\n6                                                                                                這些店家吃人血饅頭，超噁爛\n  likeCount          publishedAt            updatedAt viewerRating canRate\n1        58 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z         none    TRUE\n2         0 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z         none    TRUE\n3       345 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z         none    TRUE\n4         1 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z         none    TRUE\n5       139 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z         none    TRUE\n6         4 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z         none    TRUE\n  reply\n1 FALSE\n2 FALSE\n3 FALSE\n4 FALSE\n5 FALSE\n6 FALSE\n\ndata1_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata2_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata3_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata4_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata5_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata6_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments_cleaned.csv\")"

First, a Word Cloud visualization (generated using the Word_cloud_visualization.R script) provided an intuitive, qualitative representation of high-frequency words, instantly highlighting the most common terms associated with discussions of “SIMP” behavior.\nSecond, I conducted a quantitative rank-frequency analysis by applying Zipf’s Law to the word corpus. After arranging all unique words by descending frequency and assigning a rank, I plotted the resulting distribution using the ggplot2 package. The resulting visualization confirmed that the comment discourse adheres to a Zipfian distribution, where a few words account for a disproportionate share of the total vocabulary.\nThe key terms driving the discourse were clearly identifiable:\nThese visualizations collectively offer both quantitative validation (Zipf’s Law distribution) and qualitative insight (Word Cloud/Top Terms) into how the audience discusses and perceives the central event and the related concept of “SIMP” behavior in this context.

Each word was repeated according to its frequency (total_count) to create co-occurrence information, which is essential for small datasets where natural co-occurrences are limited. The repeated words were then combined into a single space-separated pseudo-document and used to train a skip-gram Word2Vec model with a vector dimension of 50, window size of 5, and 50 iterations, setting min_count = 1 to include all words.\nThe resulting word vectors allow calculation of cosine similarity to examine semantic relationships between words, as well as clustering and downstream supervised learning tasks. For example, the vector for a keyword such as “為什麼” can be compared with all other word vectors to identify the top semantically similar words, revealing patterns in how concepts related to “SIMP” behavior are discussed in YouTube comments.

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis\nFor sentiment analysis, I applied a custom Chinese sentiment dictionary tailored to the context of “SIMP” behavior. The dictionary categorizes words into three groups: positive (supportive or relationship-related words such as “女朋友” and “關心”), negative (critical or unfairness-related words such as “不值得” and “不公平”), and behavior (attention-seeking or “simp” behavior words such as “pua” and “追求”). Using R, I computed sentiment scores for each word in the dataset by summing occurrences in these categories. A raw polarity score was calculated as the sum of positive and behavior counts minus negative counts, then normalized by the total occurrences of all dictionary words to produce a relative polarity measure.\nThe analysis revealed that the current positive and negative categories do not fully capture the sentiment expressed in the comments. Some words were misclassified or contextually ambiguous, highlighting that the dictionary needs further adjustment and refinement to improve accuracy. Polarity distributions were visualized using a histogram, providing an overview of how positive, negative, and behavior-related language appears in discussions of “SIMP” behavior. This approach provides a preliminary sentiment assessment while acknowledging the limitations of the existing dictionary.\n\nsource(\"Sentiment Analysis.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ lubridate 1.9.4\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ NLP::annotate()         masks ggplot2::annotate()\n✖ httr::content()         masks NLP::content()\n✖ dplyr::filter()         masks stats::filter()\n✖ jsonlite::flatten()     masks purrr::flatten()\n✖ rvest::guess_encoding() masks readr::guess_encoding()\n✖ dplyr::lag()            masks stats::lag()\n✖ koRpus::tokenize()      masks readr::tokenize()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textmodels' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stopwords' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'stopwords'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nWarning: package 'caret' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\nAttaching package: 'caret'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:httr':\n\n    progress\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    lift\n\n\n[1] \"DFM after Custom Simp Dictionary Lookup (Counts per category):\"\n\n### SUPERVISED LEARNING (Naive Bayes Classification)\n[1] \"Confusion Matrix:\"\n\n### LEXICON-BASED NTUSD SENTIMENT RESULTS\n[1] \"Mean Sentiment Score by Simping Label (NTUSD):\"\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  contains_simp_factor mean_sentiment\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 FALSE                       -0.0990\n2 TRUE                        -0.477 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph:\nX-Axis: Simping Label:\n\nFALSE: Comments that do not contain any of the words from your custom “simp” dictionary (e.g., “舔狗,” “工具人,” “一廂情願,” etc.).\nTRUE: Comments that do contain at least one word from your custom “simp” dictionary.\n\nY-Axis: Comment Sentiment Score:\n\nPositive Scores (above 0): Indicate a more positive overall sentiment.\nZero (0): Indicates a neutral or balanced sentiment.\nNegative Scores (below 0): Indicate a more negative overall sentiment."

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis Summary\nThe lexicon-based sentiment analysis, utilizing the NTUSD dictionary, reveals a pronounced negative emotional shift in texts discussing the “simp” phenomenon. Specifically, content that contains terms from the custom dictionary—which targets themes like “simp behavior” (e.g., 舔狗, simp), “victim position” (e.g., 受害者, pua), and “relationship imbalance”—shows a highly negative mean sentiment score of -0.477. This score is significantly more negative than the average score of -0.0990 found in texts that do not contain these specific terms. This sharp difference (a nearly five-fold increase in negative sentiment magnitude) indicates that conversations about excessive one-sided effort, perceived exploitation, and unequal relationships—the core of the “simp” concept—are strongly associated with negative emotional discourse within the corpus."

    "text": "Supervised Learning Analysis (Naive Bayes Classification)\nThe Naive Bayes model was employed to classify comments based on whether they contained the “simp” factor, using a cleaned feature set that excluded all words from the custom “simp” dictionary to prevent data leakage. The model achieved an overall Accuracy of 81.69%, which is slightly higher than the No Information Rate (NIR) of 80.36%, indicating its performance is marginally better than random guessing based on class prevalence.\nHowever, a closer look at the results reveals a significant class imbalance issue and skewed performance:\n\nHigh Sensitivity (Recall): The model is excellent at correctly identifying comments that do NOT contain the simp factor (the majority class, FALSE), with a high Sensitivity of 95.72%.\nLow Specificity: Conversely, the model is very poor at correctly identifying comments that DO contain the simp factor (the minority class, TRUE), with a low Specificity of 24.29%.\nKappa Value: The Kappa statistic of 0.2565 suggests only a fair level of agreement beyond chance.\n\nIn summary, the high overall accuracy is largely driven by correctly classifying the prevalent negative class (FALSE). The model struggles to reliably identify actual “simp” comments (TRUE), suggesting that the remaining general vocabulary in the comments lacks sufficient predictive power to consistently distinguish between the two categories without the core dictionary terms.\n\nsource(\"Supervised_Learning.R\")\n\n\n--- Solving Data Leakage: Remove the word which exist in Simp dictionary ---\n[1] \"Original (matrix_main): 2703\"\n[1] \"Remove the word in Simp dictionary (X_cleaned): 2674\"\n\n--- 6.

Crucially, it prunes the vocabulary by removing words that occur less than three times (term_count_min = 3), which helps reduce noise and improves the quality of the derived topics.\nDTM Creation: The processed tokens are converted into a Document-Term Matrix (DTM), which is the input required for LDA.\nModel Training: The script initializes and trains an LDA model with a predefined number of topics (K=8) and 500 iterations.\nOutput: Finally, the code extracts and saves two key results: the Topic-Word distribution (the top 10 most characteristic words for each of the 8 topics) and the Document-Topic distribution (the probability that each comment belongs to each topic), storing both as CSV files for subsequent qualitative analysis.\n\n\nsource(\"Topic_Model.R\")\n\n[1] \"Starting

phenomenon with discussions about specific gender roles and identities within the Chinese context. The presence of “Not worth it” suggests this cluster is focused on evaluating the value of actions/relationships under the PUA framework.\nPUA & Gender Dynamics in China\n\n\nTopic 1\nThis topic mixes uncertainty and specific financial figures (Over 10k yuan), directly linked to PUA. It suggests discussions about high-stakes financial loss or investment by an individual in a relationship where the outcome or reality is unclear.\nFinancial Dimension of PUA & Uncertainty\n\n\nTopic 2\nThe simultaneous presence of “Victim,” “PUA,” and “Truly is” indicates a core discussion cluster dedicated to validating the existence and reality of being exploited. “McDonald’s” implies cheap/casual provision, while “Family’s” suggests the conversation may touch on the origins or impact of these dynamics within a family unit.\nValidating Victimhood & Low-Cost Exploitation\n\n\nTopic 3\nThis topic is saturated with questioning terms (“Is it?”, “Why?”, “Don’t know”), applied directly to boyfriend/girlfriend roles and the concept of gender equality. It represents a pervasive atmosphere of skepticism and critical discussion about expected behavior in modern relationships.\nSkepticism & Questioning of Relationship Roles\n\n\nTopic 4\nA highly polarized topic that denies (不可能, 不存在) the relevance or existence of Male Superiority (男尊女卑). It focuses on the possibility of being together (在一起), suggesting a desire for modern, equal partnerships and a strong rejection of patriarchal norms.\nDenial of Traditional Patriarchy in Relationships\n\n\nTopic 5\nTerms like “More and more” and “Majority” point to a discussion of social trends and scale. When combined with “Victim” and “Girlfriend,” it indicates a conversation about whether victimhood is becoming increasingly common or if the perception of victimhood is changing within the female partner role.\nDiscussing Shifting Social Norms & Victim Pool\n\n\nTopic 6\nThis is the most explicitly transactional topic. It discusses financial payment (RMB) and the concept of a person being reduced to a “Trash Can” (worthless/emotional dumping ground). The use of “And not” suggests a debate over what a relationship should be versus what it currently is (i.e., not a transaction, but one of money/exploitation).\nMonetary Value vs. Emotional Worth (The Price of Simping)\n\n\nTopic 7\nThis topic links resource provision (implied by “Buffet” and “Highway,” often used as metaphors for free/easy access) with discussions of Inequality and Gender Equality. It debates whether resources should be provided freely, who is responsible for providing them, and the resulting fairness in the relationship structure.\nResource Provision & Equality Debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTM\nTopic_Word_Rank\n\n\nV1\nTopic_0\n\n\nV2\nTopic_1\n\n\nV3\nTopic_2\n\n\nV4\nTopic_3\n\n\nV5\nTopic_4\n\n\nV6\nTopic_5\n\n\nV7\nTopic_6\n\n\nV8\nTopic_7"

    "text": "Causal Inference\nIn the casual inference part, I present the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to analyze how the probability of eight LDA topics influences the number of likes received by a comment (likeCount). Topic V8 (PUA/Victim) was set as the reference group (Reference Topic) in the model. Overall, the model’s explanatory power is extremely low (\\(\\text{Adjusted R-squared} = 0.00025\\)), suggesting that the variation in likeCount is primarily influenced by factors outside the model, rather than the topics themselves. However, the coefficient tests for individual topics revealed that Topic V2 demonstrated a statistically significant positive influence. After controlling for the effects of other topics, an increase of 1 unit in the probability of Topic V2 (Financial/Money II), relative to the reference group V8, is expected to increase the number of likes by approximately 9.66 (\\(p = 0.038^{*}\\)). This suggests that specific discussion content related to money or finance is more likely to garner attention and agreement within the community. Apart from the intercept, the remaining topics (V1, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7) did not show a statistically significant relationship with the number of likes.\n\nsource(\"Causal_Inference.R\")\n\nRows: 3006 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (9): doc_id, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n[1] \"--- OLS Regression Results (Outcome: likeCount) ---\"\n[1] \"Reference Topic: V8 (PUA/Victim)\"\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = likeCount ~ V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6 + V7, data = merged_df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n -18.59   -8.93   -6.76   -5.12 1763.41 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This specific form of critical discussion related to ‘SIMP’ behavior is extremely negative in sentiment (\\(\\text{mean}\\) \\(\\text{sentiment} = -0.477\\)) and is so unique in its linguistic pattern that its occurrence can be accurately predicted by the supervised learning model. Consequently, the community’s response to ‘SIMP’ behavior is highly concentrated and emotionally charged, with its online visibility predominantly stemming from comments that link the behavior directly to concrete financial inequality and victim scenarios.”"

    "section": "Future",
    "text": "Future\nFuture work should prioritize addressing the observed limitations in both the supervised classification model and the initial data preprocessing pipeline to enhance the robustness and explanatory power of the analysis. Firstly, while the initial Naive Bayes classifier provided baseline insights, its predictive performance should be critically re-evaluated. Improving the accuracy of the automated simp classification label requires exploring more sophisticated machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting, or even Transformer-based deep learning models. Concurrently, enhancing the feature set by refining or expanding the custom dictionaries—perhaps incorporating sentiment scores or incorporating word embeddings—could significantly boost the model’s ability to discriminate between classes, moving beyond simple bag-of-words approaches. Secondly, a crucial area for improvement lies in the token filtering and data processing stage. Despite standard removal procedures, the presence of numerous contextually irrelevant tokens, such as specific objects (“高速公路”) and brands (“麥當勞”), confirms the necessity of a more rigorous, domain-specific cleanup. Future efforts must focus on constructing an expanded, domain-aware stop word list or implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to systematically identify and remove non-topical, low-information tokens, ensuring the remaining features are highly predictive and representative of the core concepts being discussed."
