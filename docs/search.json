I utilized an R scraping script to extract approximately 8,000 comments in total. Following a cleaning and filtering process, a dataset of around 7,000 practical comments was retained for analysis.\nI specifically focused on the case study known as the “胖貓跳江事件” (Suicide of Fat Cat). This event, which occurred in Mainland China, provides a particularly rich and relevant dataset because it was a well-documented news story officially reported by the Chinese court. This official documentation makes it a real and verifiable event, distinguishing it from mere rumors or social media anecdotes. Furthermore, the use of Chinese-language videos as the reference source is critical, as the Chinese-speaking audience possesses extensive background knowledge and cultural context directly related to the local details of this incident.\n\nSIMP001 - 陪打遊戲賺百萬養女友慘遭分手！「胖貓事件」引爆中國性別戰爭？「撈女」滿街跑的背後原因？【TODAY 看世界】(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TfkwlthWU&t=13s) 1952 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP002 - 当胖猫遇到捞女，一个年轻人如何走上不归路？｜女权｜捞女｜胖猫｜王者荣耀｜男女平权｜日本｜梅大高速｜舆论控制｜王局拍案20240507 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Gq_eOPuDY&t=1s) 3731 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP003 - 老梁：给“胖猫”多条选择 重庆“胖猫事件”不是性别大战 如何避免成为“胖猫”(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjcgg0wFpfE) 997 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP004 - 小伙為愛跳江，拜金的女友，吸血的親姐，無良的商家，瘋狂的網民，誰才是加害者？為何警察認定女友無罪，反而是親姐違了法？一口氣看完胖貓事件始末！| Wayne調查(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igs7GoIU4MU) 615 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP005 - 神級陪玩「胖貓」遭詐乾227萬亡 女友道歉｜20240506 ET午間新聞 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE83zZEcOY) 402 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP006 - 被撈女騙光50萬，遊戲宅男跳江自殺，轟動全網！撈女譚竹榨乾胖貓事件真相！『新闻最嘲点 姜光宇』2024.0508(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYngd2Yt3zk) 271 comments from 11/04/2025\n\n\nlibrary(plyr)\n\nWarning: package 'plyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise,\n    summarize\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nWarning: package 'tidytext' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'purrr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    compact\n\nlibrary(chromote)\n\nWarning: package 'chromote' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(stargazer)\n\n\nPlease cite as: \n\n\n Hlavac, Marek (2022). stargazer: Well-Formatted Regression and Summary Statistics Tables.\n\n\n R package version 5.2.3. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stargazer \n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\nWarning: package 'corrplot' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n\nlibrary(tm)\n\nWarning: package 'tm' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: NLP\n\n\nWarning: package 'NLP' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'NLP'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\nlibrary(wordcloud)\n\nWarning: package 'wordcloud' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: RColorBrewer\n\nlibrary(quanteda)\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nPackage version: 4.3.1\nUnicode version: 15.1\nICU version: 74.1\n\n\nParallel computing: 12 of 12 threads used.\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'quanteda'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    meta, meta&lt;-\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nWarning: package 'rvest' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textplots\")\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textplots' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr)\n\nWarning: package 'httr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'httr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    content\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(RedditExtractoR)\n\nWarning: package 'RedditExtractoR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nWarning: package 'httr2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments.csv\")\ndata3 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments.csv\")\ndata4 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments.csv\")\ndata5 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments.csv\")\ndata6 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments.csv\")"

The original structure included columns such as: videoId, commentId, parentId, author, text, likeCount, publishedAt, updatedAt, viewerRating, canRate, and reply.\nFor data cleaning, all CSV files in the Final_project_data folder were systematically processed using the R environment. The initial step was to streamline the dataset by retaining only the essential variables for textual and engagement analysis: text, likeCount, and reply.\nI utilized the R packages dplyr and stringr to focus on standardizing the text column. This involved a series of cleaning operations: normalization of whitespace (removing line breaks, tabs, and extra spaces, and trimming leading/trailing whitespace) and character filtering. Crucially, I removed non-essential symbols and unusual characters while meticulously preserving all Chinese characters to ensure the comments remained culturally authentic and meaningful for subsequent analysis.\nFinally, each cleaned and standardized dataset was saved as a new CSV file, appended with the suffix _cleaned. UTF-8 encoding was explicitly used to guarantee the accurate representation of the Chinese characters. This systematic workflow ensures the comment data are tidy, standardized, and immediately ready for downstream procedures, such as tokenization and sentiment or frequency analysis.\n\nsource(\"data_cleaning_CN.R\")\n\ndata cleaning complete!.\n\nSIMP001 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\n\n#Present the eample of the result\nhead(SIMP001)\n\n      videoId                  commentId parentId        author\n1 o5TfkwlthWU UgyekRC230MDXREkdeN4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @DanjonMeshi\n2 o5TfkwlthWU UgxangSP0zjJm6_gHfV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @paullee4451\n3 o5TfkwlthWU UgwZdLtl6Eb2wgDWaDV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;      @urikora\n4 o5TfkwlthWU UgwSmeqUyHYUXGD6l3l4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @fayechen1928\n5 o5TfkwlthWU UgwpotCAmJmn2wWU7u54AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @running_goat\n6 o5TfkwlthWU UgxQSyQbnLT9r7I1faB4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @Jack2006103\n                                                                                                                       text\n1                                                             商家集體給空袋真的笑死，不止生活在中國，連死在中國都要偷著樂😆\n2                                                                                                                      頭香\n3                       更慘的是，人都走了一個月 結果就在這時機點被抓來擋政府做的醜事（路崩華為車衝進去坑洞然後快速燃起來）\n4                                                                                      每次看到中國這種悲劇都覺得不可思議😨😭\n5 我真的必須得說對岸男女戰爭真的越來越嚴重== 問過好幾個對岸的女生都認為男生就是應該要給彩禮 吃飯就是要幫女生付錢等等 很可怕\n6                                                                                                這些店家吃人血饅頭，超噁爛\n  likeCount          publishedAt            updatedAt viewerRating canRate\n1        58 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z         none    TRUE\n2         0 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z         none    TRUE\n3       345 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z         none    TRUE\n4         1 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z         none    TRUE\n5       139 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z         none    TRUE\n6         4 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z         none    TRUE\n  reply\n1 FALSE\n2 FALSE\n3 FALSE\n4 FALSE\n5 FALSE\n6 FALSE\n\ndata1_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata2_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata3_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata4_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata5_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata6_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments_cleaned.csv\")"

First, a Word Cloud visualization (generated using the Word_cloud_visualization.R script) provided an intuitive, qualitative representation of high-frequency words, instantly highlighting the most common terms associated with discussions of “SIMP” behavior.\nSecond, I conducted a quantitative rank-frequency analysis by applying Zipf’s Law to the word corpus. After arranging all unique words by descending frequency and assigning a rank, I plotted the resulting distribution using the ggplot2 package. The resulting visualization confirmed that the comment discourse adheres to a Zipfian distribution, where a few words account for a disproportionate share of the total vocabulary.\nThe key terms driving the discourse were clearly identifiable:\nThese visualizations collectively offer both quantitative validation (Zipf’s Law distribution) and qualitative insight (Word Cloud/Top Terms) into how the audience discusses and perceives the central event and the related concept of “SIMP” behavior in this context.

Each word was repeated according to its frequency (total_count) to create co-occurrence information, which is essential for small datasets where natural co-occurrences are limited. The repeated words were then combined into a single space-separated pseudo-document and used to train a skip-gram Word2Vec model with a vector dimension of 50, window size of 5, and 50 iterations, setting min_count = 1 to include all words.\nThe resulting word vectors allow calculation of cosine similarity to examine semantic relationships between words, as well as clustering and downstream supervised learning tasks. For example, the vector for a keyword such as “為什麼” can be compared with all other word vectors to identify the top semantically similar words, revealing patterns in how concepts related to “SIMP” behavior are discussed in YouTube comments. This approach provides a robust representation of word meaning in the context of the dataset while accommodating the limited co-occurrence information inherent in smaller comment datasets.\n\n# Word2Vec can be the best option for the word embeding.\n\nsource(\"Word Embeddings.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'word2vec' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'text2vec' was built under R version 4.4.3"

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis\nFor sentiment analysis, I applied a custom Chinese sentiment dictionary tailored to the context of “SIMP” behavior. The dictionary categorizes words into three groups: positive (supportive or relationship-related words such as “女朋友” and “關心”), negative (critical or unfairness-related words such as “不值得” and “不公平”), and behavior (attention-seeking or “simp” behavior words such as “pua” and “追求”). Using R, I computed sentiment scores for each word in the dataset by summing occurrences in these categories. A raw polarity score was calculated as the sum of positive and behavior counts minus negative counts, then normalized by the total occurrences of all dictionary words to produce a relative polarity measure.\nThe analysis revealed that the current positive and negative categories do not fully capture the sentiment expressed in the comments. Some words were misclassified or contextually ambiguous, highlighting that the dictionary needs further adjustment and refinement to improve accuracy. Polarity distributions were visualized using a histogram, providing an overview of how positive, negative, and behavior-related language appears in discussions of “SIMP” behavior. This approach provides a preliminary sentiment assessment while acknowledging the limitations of the existing dictionary.\n\nsource(\"Sentiment Analysis.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ lubridate 1.9.4\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ NLP::annotate()         masks ggplot2::annotate()\n✖ httr::content()         masks NLP::content()\n✖ dplyr::filter()         masks stats::filter()\n✖ jsonlite::flatten()     masks purrr::flatten()\n✖ rvest::guess_encoding() masks readr::guess_encoding()\n✖ dplyr::lag()            masks stats::lag()\n✖ koRpus::tokenize()      masks readr::tokenize()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textmodels' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stopwords' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'stopwords'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nWarning: package 'caret' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\nAttaching package: 'caret'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:httr':\n\n    progress\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    lift\n\n\n[1] \"DFM after Custom Simp Dictionary Lookup (Counts per category):\"\n\n### SUPERVISED LEARNING (Naive Bayes Classification)\n[1] \"Confusion Matrix:\"\n\n### LEXICON-BASED NTUSD SENTIMENT RESULTS\n[1] \"Mean Sentiment Score by Simping Label (NTUSD):\"\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  contains_simp_factor mean_sentiment\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 FALSE                       -0.0990\n2 TRUE                        -0.477 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph:\nX-Axis: Simping Label:\n\nFALSE: Comments that do not contain any of the words from your custom “simp” dictionary (e.g., “舔狗,” “工具人,” “一廂情願,” etc.).\nTRUE: Comments that do contain at least one word from your custom “simp” dictionary.\n\nY-Axis: Comment Sentiment Score:\n\nPositive Scores (above 0): Indicate a more positive overall sentiment.\nZero (0): Indicates a neutral or balanced sentiment.\nNegative Scores (below 0): Indicate a more negative overall sentiment."

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis Summary\nThe lexicon-based sentiment analysis, utilizing the NTUSD dictionary, reveals a pronounced negative emotional shift in texts discussing the “simp” phenomenon. Specifically, content that contains terms from the custom dictionary—which targets themes like “simp behavior” (e.g., 舔狗, simp), “victim position” (e.g., 受害者, pua), and “relationship imbalance”—shows a highly negative mean sentiment score of -0.477. This score is significantly more negative than the average score of -0.0990 found in texts that do not contain these specific terms. This sharp difference (a nearly five-fold increase in negative sentiment magnitude) indicates that conversations about excessive one-sided effort, perceived exploitation, and unequal relationships—the core of the “simp” concept—are strongly associated with negative emotional discourse within the corpus."

    "text": "Supervised Learning Analysis (Naive Bayes Classification)\nThe Naive Bayes model was employed to classify comments based on whether they contained the “simp” factor, using a cleaned feature set that excluded all words from the custom “simp” dictionary to prevent data leakage. The model achieved an overall Accuracy of 81.69%, which is slightly higher than the No Information Rate (NIR) of 80.36%, indicating its performance is marginally better than random guessing based on class prevalence.\nHowever, a closer look at the results reveals a significant class imbalance issue and skewed performance:\n\nHigh Sensitivity (Recall): The model is excellent at correctly identifying comments that do NOT contain the simp factor (the majority class, FALSE), with a high Sensitivity of 95.72%.\nLow Specificity: Conversely, the model is very poor at correctly identifying comments that DO contain the simp factor (the minority class, TRUE), with a low Specificity of 24.29%.\nKappa Value: The Kappa statistic of 0.2565 suggests only a fair level of agreement beyond chance.\n\nIn summary, the high overall accuracy is largely driven by correctly classifying the prevalent negative class (FALSE). The model struggles to reliably identify actual “simp” comments (TRUE), suggesting that the remaining general vocabulary in the comments lacks sufficient predictive power to consistently distinguish between the two categories without the core dictionary terms.\n\nsource(\"Supervised_Learning.R\")\n\n\n--- Solving Data Leakage: Remove the word which exist in Simp dictionary ---\n[1] \"Original (matrix_main): 2703\"\n[1] \"Remove the word in Simp dictionary (X_cleaned): 2674\"\n\n--- 6.

Crucially, it prunes the vocabulary by removing words that occur less than three times (term_count_min = 3), which helps reduce noise and improves the quality of the derived topics.\nDTM Creation: The processed tokens are converted into a Document-Term Matrix (DTM), which is the input required for LDA.\nModel Training: The script initializes and trains an LDA model with a predefined number of topics (K=8) and 500 iterations.\nOutput: Finally, the code extracts and saves two key results: the Topic-Word distribution (the top 10 most characteristic words for each of the 8 topics) and the Document-Topic distribution (the probability that each comment belongs to each topic), storing both as CSV files for subsequent qualitative analysis.\n\n\nsource(\"Topic_Model.R\")\n\n[1] \"Starting

phenomenon with discussions about specific gender roles and identities within the Chinese context. The presence of “Not worth it” suggests this cluster is focused on evaluating the value of actions/relationships under the PUA framework.\nPUA & Gender Dynamics in China\n\n\nTopic 1\nThis topic mixes uncertainty and specific financial figures (Over 10k yuan), directly linked to PUA. It suggests discussions about high-stakes financial loss or investment by an individual in a relationship where the outcome or reality is unclear.\nFinancial Dimension of PUA & Uncertainty\n\n\nTopic 2\nThe simultaneous presence of “Victim,” “PUA,” and “Truly is” indicates a core discussion cluster dedicated to validating the existence and reality of being exploited. “McDonald’s” implies cheap/casual provision, while “Family’s” suggests the conversation may touch on the origins or impact of these dynamics within a family unit.\nValidating Victimhood & Low-Cost Exploitation\n\n\nTopic 3\nThis topic is saturated with questioning terms (“Is it?”, “Why?”, “Don’t know”), applied directly to boyfriend/girlfriend roles and the concept of gender equality. It represents a pervasive atmosphere of skepticism and critical discussion about expected behavior in modern relationships.\nSkepticism & Questioning of Relationship Roles\n\n\nTopic 4\nA highly polarized topic that denies (不可能, 不存在) the relevance or existence of Male Superiority (男尊女卑). It focuses on the possibility of being together (在一起), suggesting a desire for modern, equal partnerships and a strong rejection of patriarchal norms.\nDenial of Traditional Patriarchy in Relationships\n\n\nTopic 5\nTerms like “More and more” and “Majority” point to a discussion of social trends and scale. When combined with “Victim” and “Girlfriend,” it indicates a conversation about whether victimhood is becoming increasingly common or if the perception of victimhood is changing within the female partner role.\nDiscussing Shifting Social Norms & Victim Pool\n\n\nTopic 6\nThis is the most explicitly transactional topic. It discusses financial payment (RMB) and the concept of a person being reduced to a “Trash Can” (worthless/emotional dumping ground). The use of “And not” suggests a debate over what a relationship should be versus what it currently is (i.e., not a transaction, but one of money/exploitation).\nMonetary Value vs. Emotional Worth (The Price of Simping)\n\n\nTopic 7\nThis topic links resource provision (implied by “Buffet” and “Highway,” often used as metaphors for free/easy access) with discussions of Inequality and Gender Equality. It debates whether resources should be provided freely, who is responsible for providing them, and the resulting fairness in the relationship structure.\nResource Provision & Equality Debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTM\nTopic_Word_Rank\n\n\nV1\nTopic_0\n\n\nV2\nTopic_1\n\n\nV3\nTopic_2\n\n\nV4\nTopic_3\n\n\nV5\nTopic_4\n\n\nV6\nTopic_5\n\n\nV7\nTopic_6\n\n\nV8\nTopic_7"

    "text": "Causal Inference\nIn the casual inference part, I present the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to analyze how the probability of eight LDA topics influences the number of likes received by a comment (likeCount). Topic V8 (PUA/Victim) was set as the reference group (Reference Topic) in the model. Overall, the model’s explanatory power is extremely low (\\(\\text{Adjusted R-squared} = 0.00025\\)), suggesting that the variation in likeCount is primarily influenced by factors outside the model, rather than the topics themselves. However, the coefficient tests for individual topics revealed that Topic V2 demonstrated a statistically significant positive influence. After controlling for the effects of other topics, an increase of 1 unit in the probability of Topic V2 (Financial/Money II), relative to the reference group V8, is expected to increase the number of likes by approximately 9.66 (\\(p = 0.038^{*}\\)). This suggests that specific discussion content related to money or finance is more likely to garner attention and agreement within the community. Apart from the intercept, the remaining topics (V1, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7) did not show a statistically significant relationship with the number of likes.\n\nsource(\"Causal_Inference.R\")\n\nRows: 3006 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (9): doc_id, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n[1] \"--- OLS Regression Results (Outcome: likeCount) ---\"\n[1] \"Reference Topic: V8 (PUA/Victim)\"\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = likeCount ~ V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6 + V7, data = merged_df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n -18.59   -8.93   -6.76   -5.12 1763.41 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This specific form of critical discussion related to ‘SIMP’ behavior is extremely negative in sentiment (\\(\\text{mean}\\) \\(\\text{sentiment} = -0.477\\)) and is so unique in its linguistic pattern that its occurrence can be accurately predicted by the supervised learning model. Consequently, the community’s response to ‘SIMP’ behavior is highly concentrated and emotionally charged, with its online visibility predominantly stemming from comments that link the behavior directly to concrete financial inequality and victim scenarios.”"

    "section": "Future",
    "text": "Future\nFuture work should prioritize addressing the observed limitations in both the supervised classification model and the initial data preprocessing pipeline to enhance the robustness and explanatory power of the analysis. Firstly, while the initial Naive Bayes classifier provided baseline insights, its predictive performance should be critically re-evaluated. Improving the accuracy of the automated simp classification label requires exploring more sophisticated machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting, or even Transformer-based deep learning models. Concurrently, enhancing the feature set by refining or expanding the custom dictionaries—perhaps incorporating sentiment scores or incorporating word embeddings—could significantly boost the model’s ability to discriminate between classes, moving beyond simple bag-of-words approaches. Secondly, a crucial area for improvement lies in the token filtering and data processing stage. Despite standard removal procedures, the presence of numerous contextually irrelevant tokens, such as specific objects (“高速公路”) and brands (“麥當勞”), confirms the necessity of a more rigorous, domain-specific cleanup. Future efforts must focus on constructing an expanded, domain-aware stop word list or implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to systematically identify and remove non-topical, low-information tokens, ensuring the remaining features are highly predictive and representative of the core concepts being discussed."

I utilized an R scraping script to extract approximately 8,000 comments in total. Following a cleaning and filtering process, a dataset of around 7,000 practical comments was retained for analysis.\nI specifically focused on the case study known as the “胖貓跳江事件” (Suicide of Fat Cat). This event, which occurred in Mainland China, provides a particularly rich and relevant dataset because it was a well-documented news story officially reported by the Chinese court. This official documentation makes it a real and verifiable event, distinguishing it from mere rumors or social media anecdotes. Furthermore, the use of Chinese-language videos as the reference source is critical, as the Chinese-speaking audience possesses extensive background knowledge and cultural context directly related to the local details of this incident.\n\nSIMP001 - 陪打遊戲賺百萬養女友慘遭分手！「胖貓事件」引爆中國性別戰爭？「撈女」滿街跑的背後原因？【TODAY 看世界】(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TfkwlthWU&t=13s) 1952 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP002 - 当胖猫遇到捞女，一个年轻人如何走上不归路？｜女权｜捞女｜胖猫｜王者荣耀｜男女平权｜日本｜梅大高速｜舆论控制｜王局拍案20240507 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Gq_eOPuDY&t=1s) 3731 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP003 - 老梁：给“胖猫”多条选择 重庆“胖猫事件”不是性别大战 如何避免成为“胖猫”(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjcgg0wFpfE) 997 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP004 - 小伙為愛跳江，拜金的女友，吸血的親姐，無良的商家，瘋狂的網民，誰才是加害者？為何警察認定女友無罪，反而是親姐違了法？一口氣看完胖貓事件始末！| Wayne調查(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igs7GoIU4MU) 615 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP005 - 神級陪玩「胖貓」遭詐乾227萬亡 女友道歉｜20240506 ET午間新聞 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE83zZEcOY) 402 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP006 - 被撈女騙光50萬，遊戲宅男跳江自殺，轟動全網！撈女譚竹榨乾胖貓事件真相！『新闻最嘲点 姜光宇』2024.0508(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYngd2Yt3zk) 271 comments from 11/04/2025\n\n\nlibrary(plyr)\n\nWarning: package 'plyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise,\n    summarize\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nWarning: package 'tidytext' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'purrr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    compact\n\nlibrary(chromote)\n\nWarning: package 'chromote' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(stargazer)\n\n\nPlease cite as: \n\n\n Hlavac, Marek (2022). stargazer: Well-Formatted Regression and Summary Statistics Tables.\n\n\n R package version 5.2.3. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stargazer \n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\nWarning: package 'corrplot' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n\nlibrary(tm)\n\nWarning: package 'tm' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: NLP\n\n\nWarning: package 'NLP' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'NLP'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\nlibrary(wordcloud)\n\nWarning: package 'wordcloud' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: RColorBrewer\n\nlibrary(quanteda)\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nPackage version: 4.3.1\nUnicode version: 15.1\nICU version: 74.1\n\n\nParallel computing: 12 of 12 threads used.\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'quanteda'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    meta, meta&lt;-\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nWarning: package 'rvest' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textplots\")\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textplots' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr)\n\nWarning: package 'httr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'httr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    content\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(RedditExtractoR)\n\nWarning: package 'RedditExtractoR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nWarning: package 'httr2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments.csv\")\ndata3 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments.csv\")\ndata4 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments.csv\")\ndata5 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments.csv\")\ndata6 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments.csv\")"

The original structure included columns such as: videoId, commentId, parentId, author, text, likeCount, publishedAt, updatedAt, viewerRating, canRate, and reply.\nFor data cleaning, all CSV files in the Final_project_data folder were systematically processed using the R environment. The initial step was to streamline the dataset by retaining only the essential variables for textual and engagement analysis: text, likeCount, and reply.\nI utilized the R packages dplyr and stringr to focus on standardizing the text column. This involved a series of cleaning operations: normalization of whitespace (removing line breaks, tabs, and extra spaces, and trimming leading/trailing whitespace) and character filtering. Crucially, I removed non-essential symbols and unusual characters while meticulously preserving all Chinese characters to ensure the comments remained culturally authentic and meaningful for subsequent analysis.\nFinally, each cleaned and standardized dataset was saved as a new CSV file, appended with the suffix _cleaned. UTF-8 encoding was explicitly used to guarantee the accurate representation of the Chinese characters. This systematic workflow ensures the comment data are tidy, standardized, and immediately ready for downstream procedures, such as tokenization and sentiment or frequency analysis.\n\nsource(\"data_cleaning_CN.R\")\n\ndata cleaning complete!.\n\nSIMP001 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\n\n#Present the eample of the result\nhead(SIMP001)\n\n      videoId                  commentId parentId        author\n1 o5TfkwlthWU UgyekRC230MDXREkdeN4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @DanjonMeshi\n2 o5TfkwlthWU UgxangSP0zjJm6_gHfV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @paullee4451\n3 o5TfkwlthWU UgwZdLtl6Eb2wgDWaDV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;      @urikora\n4 o5TfkwlthWU UgwSmeqUyHYUXGD6l3l4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @fayechen1928\n5 o5TfkwlthWU UgwpotCAmJmn2wWU7u54AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @running_goat\n6 o5TfkwlthWU UgxQSyQbnLT9r7I1faB4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @Jack2006103\n                                                                                                                       text\n1                                                             商家集體給空袋真的笑死，不止生活在中國，連死在中國都要偷著樂😆\n2                                                                                                                      頭香\n3                       更慘的是，人都走了一個月 結果就在這時機點被抓來擋政府做的醜事（路崩華為車衝進去坑洞然後快速燃起來）\n4                                                                                      每次看到中國這種悲劇都覺得不可思議😨😭\n5 我真的必須得說對岸男女戰爭真的越來越嚴重== 問過好幾個對岸的女生都認為男生就是應該要給彩禮 吃飯就是要幫女生付錢等等 很可怕\n6                                                                                                這些店家吃人血饅頭，超噁爛\n  likeCount          publishedAt            updatedAt viewerRating canRate\n1        58 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z         none    TRUE\n2         0 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z         none    TRUE\n3       345 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z         none    TRUE\n4         1 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z         none    TRUE\n5       139 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z         none    TRUE\n6         4 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z         none    TRUE\n  reply\n1 FALSE\n2 FALSE\n3 FALSE\n4 FALSE\n5 FALSE\n6 FALSE\n\ndata1_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata2_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata3_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata4_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata5_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata6_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments_cleaned.csv\")"

First, a Word Cloud visualization (generated using the Word_cloud_visualization.R script) provided an intuitive, qualitative representation of high-frequency words, instantly highlighting the most common terms associated with discussions of “SIMP” behavior.\nSecond, I conducted a quantitative rank-frequency analysis by applying Zipf’s Law to the word corpus. After arranging all unique words by descending frequency and assigning a rank, I plotted the resulting distribution using the ggplot2 package. The resulting visualization confirmed that the comment discourse adheres to a Zipfian distribution, where a few words account for a disproportionate share of the total vocabulary.\nThe key terms driving the discourse were clearly identifiable:\nThese visualizations collectively offer both quantitative validation (Zipf’s Law distribution) and qualitative insight (Word Cloud/Top Terms) into how the audience discusses and perceives the central event and the related concept of “SIMP” behavior in this context.

Each word was repeated according to its frequency (total_count) to create co-occurrence information, which is essential for small datasets where natural co-occurrences are limited. The repeated words were then combined into a single space-separated pseudo-document and used to train a skip-gram Word2Vec model with a vector dimension of 50, window size of 5, and 50 iterations, setting min_count = 1 to include all words.\nThe resulting word vectors allow calculation of cosine similarity to examine semantic relationships between words, as well as clustering and downstream supervised learning tasks. For example, the vector for a keyword such as “為什麼” can be compared with all other word vectors to identify the top semantically similar words, revealing patterns in how concepts related to “SIMP” behavior are discussed in YouTube comments. This approach provides a robust representation of word meaning in the context of the dataset while accommodating the limited co-occurrence information inherent in smaller comment datasets.\n\n# Word2Vec can be the best option for the word embeding.\n\nsource(\"Word Embeddings.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'word2vec' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'text2vec' was built under R version 4.4.3"

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis\nFor sentiment analysis, I applied a custom Chinese sentiment dictionary tailored to the context of “SIMP” behavior. The dictionary categorizes words into three groups: positive (supportive or relationship-related words such as “女朋友” and “關心”), negative (critical or unfairness-related words such as “不值得” and “不公平”), and behavior (attention-seeking or “simp” behavior words such as “pua” and “追求”). Using R, I computed sentiment scores for each word in the dataset by summing occurrences in these categories. A raw polarity score was calculated as the sum of positive and behavior counts minus negative counts, then normalized by the total occurrences of all dictionary words to produce a relative polarity measure.\nThe analysis revealed that the current positive and negative categories do not fully capture the sentiment expressed in the comments. Some words were misclassified or contextually ambiguous, highlighting that the dictionary needs further adjustment and refinement to improve accuracy. Polarity distributions were visualized using a histogram, providing an overview of how positive, negative, and behavior-related language appears in discussions of “SIMP” behavior. This approach provides a preliminary sentiment assessment while acknowledging the limitations of the existing dictionary.\n\nsource(\"Sentiment Analysis.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ lubridate 1.9.4\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ NLP::annotate()         masks ggplot2::annotate()\n✖ httr::content()         masks NLP::content()\n✖ dplyr::filter()         masks stats::filter()\n✖ jsonlite::flatten()     masks purrr::flatten()\n✖ rvest::guess_encoding() masks readr::guess_encoding()\n✖ dplyr::lag()            masks stats::lag()\n✖ koRpus::tokenize()      masks readr::tokenize()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textmodels' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stopwords' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'stopwords'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nWarning: package 'caret' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\nAttaching package: 'caret'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:httr':\n\n    progress\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    lift\n\n\n[1] \"DFM after Custom Simp Dictionary Lookup (Counts per category):\"\n\n### SUPERVISED LEARNING (Naive Bayes Classification)\n[1] \"Confusion Matrix:\"\n\n### LEXICON-BASED NTUSD SENTIMENT RESULTS\n[1] \"Mean Sentiment Score by Simping Label (NTUSD):\"\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  contains_simp_factor mean_sentiment\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 FALSE                       -0.0990\n2 TRUE                        -0.477 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph:\nX-Axis: Simping Label:\n\nFALSE: Comments that do not contain any of the words from your custom “simp” dictionary (e.g., “舔狗,” “工具人,” “一廂情願,” etc.).\nTRUE: Comments that do contain at least one word from your custom “simp” dictionary.\n\nY-Axis: Comment Sentiment Score:\n\nPositive Scores (above 0): Indicate a more positive overall sentiment.\nZero (0): Indicates a neutral or balanced sentiment.\nNegative Scores (below 0): Indicate a more negative overall sentiment."

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis Summary\nThe lexicon-based sentiment analysis, utilizing the NTUSD dictionary, reveals a pronounced negative emotional shift in texts discussing the “simp” phenomenon. Specifically, content that contains terms from the custom dictionary—which targets themes like “simp behavior” (e.g., 舔狗, simp), “victim position” (e.g., 受害者, pua), and “relationship imbalance”—shows a highly negative mean sentiment score of -0.477. This score is significantly more negative than the average score of -0.0990 found in texts that do not contain these specific terms. This sharp difference (a nearly five-fold increase in negative sentiment magnitude) indicates that conversations about excessive one-sided effort, perceived exploitation, and unequal relationships—the core of the “simp” concept—are strongly associated with negative emotional discourse within the corpus."

    "text": "Supervised Learning Analysis (Naive Bayes Classification)\nThe Naive Bayes model was employed to classify comments based on whether they contained the “simp” factor, using a cleaned feature set that excluded all words from the custom “simp” dictionary to prevent data leakage. The model achieved an overall Accuracy of 81.69%, which is slightly higher than the No Information Rate (NIR) of 80.36%, indicating its performance is marginally better than random guessing based on class prevalence.\nHowever, a closer look at the results reveals a significant class imbalance issue and skewed performance:\n\nHigh Sensitivity (Recall): The model is excellent at correctly identifying comments that do NOT contain the simp factor (the majority class, FALSE), with a high Sensitivity of 95.72%.\nLow Specificity: Conversely, the model is very poor at correctly identifying comments that DO contain the simp factor (the minority class, TRUE), with a low Specificity of 24.29%.\nKappa Value: The Kappa statistic of 0.2565 suggests only a fair level of agreement beyond chance.\n\nIn summary, the high overall accuracy is largely driven by correctly classifying the prevalent negative class (FALSE). The model struggles to reliably identify actual “simp” comments (TRUE), suggesting that the remaining general vocabulary in the comments lacks sufficient predictive power to consistently distinguish between the two categories without the core dictionary terms.\n\nsource(\"Supervised_Learning.R\")\n\n\n--- Solving Data Leakage: Remove the word which exist in Simp dictionary ---\n[1] \"Original (matrix_main): 2703\"\n[1] \"Remove the word in Simp dictionary (X_cleaned): 2674\"\n\n--- 6.

Crucially, it prunes the vocabulary by removing words that occur less than three times (term_count_min = 3), which helps reduce noise and improves the quality of the derived topics.\nDTM Creation: The processed tokens are converted into a Document-Term Matrix (DTM), which is the input required for LDA.\nModel Training: The script initializes and trains an LDA model with a predefined number of topics (K=8) and 500 iterations.\nOutput: Finally, the code extracts and saves two key results: the Topic-Word distribution (the top 10 most characteristic words for each of the 8 topics) and the Document-Topic distribution (the probability that each comment belongs to each topic), storing both as CSV files for subsequent qualitative analysis.\n\n\nsource(\"Topic_Model.R\")\n\n[1] \"Starting

phenomenon with discussions about specific gender roles and identities within the Chinese context. The presence of “Not worth it” suggests this cluster is focused on evaluating the value of actions/relationships under the PUA framework.\nPUA & Gender Dynamics in China\n\n\nTopic 1\nThis topic mixes uncertainty and specific financial figures (Over 10k yuan), directly linked to PUA. It suggests discussions about high-stakes financial loss or investment by an individual in a relationship where the outcome or reality is unclear.\nFinancial Dimension of PUA & Uncertainty\n\n\nTopic 2\nThe simultaneous presence of “Victim,” “PUA,” and “Truly is” indicates a core discussion cluster dedicated to validating the existence and reality of being exploited. “McDonald’s” implies cheap/casual provision, while “Family’s” suggests the conversation may touch on the origins or impact of these dynamics within a family unit.\nValidating Victimhood & Low-Cost Exploitation\n\n\nTopic 3\nThis topic is saturated with questioning terms (“Is it?”, “Why?”, “Don’t know”), applied directly to boyfriend/girlfriend roles and the concept of gender equality. It represents a pervasive atmosphere of skepticism and critical discussion about expected behavior in modern relationships.\nSkepticism & Questioning of Relationship Roles\n\n\nTopic 4\nA highly polarized topic that denies (不可能, 不存在) the relevance or existence of Male Superiority (男尊女卑). It focuses on the possibility of being together (在一起), suggesting a desire for modern, equal partnerships and a strong rejection of patriarchal norms.\nDenial of Traditional Patriarchy in Relationships\n\n\nTopic 5\nTerms like “More and more” and “Majority” point to a discussion of social trends and scale. When combined with “Victim” and “Girlfriend,” it indicates a conversation about whether victimhood is becoming increasingly common or if the perception of victimhood is changing within the female partner role.\nDiscussing Shifting Social Norms & Victim Pool\n\n\nTopic 6\nThis is the most explicitly transactional topic. It discusses financial payment (RMB) and the concept of a person being reduced to a “Trash Can” (worthless/emotional dumping ground). The use of “And not” suggests a debate over what a relationship should be versus what it currently is (i.e., not a transaction, but one of money/exploitation).\nMonetary Value vs. Emotional Worth (The Price of Simping)\n\n\nTopic 7\nThis topic links resource provision (implied by “Buffet” and “Highway,” often used as metaphors for free/easy access) with discussions of Inequality and Gender Equality. It debates whether resources should be provided freely, who is responsible for providing them, and the resulting fairness in the relationship structure.\nResource Provision & Equality Debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTM\nTopic_Word_Rank\n\n\nV1\nTopic_0\n\n\nV2\nTopic_1\n\n\nV3\nTopic_2\n\n\nV4\nTopic_3\n\n\nV5\nTopic_4\n\n\nV6\nTopic_5\n\n\nV7\nTopic_6\n\n\nV8\nTopic_7"

    "text": "Causal Inference\nIn the casual inference part, I present the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to analyze how the probability of eight LDA topics influences the number of likes received by a comment (likeCount). Topic V8 (PUA/Victim) was set as the reference group (Reference Topic) in the model. Overall, the model’s explanatory power is extremely low (\\(\\text{Adjusted R-squared} = 0.00025\\)), suggesting that the variation in likeCount is primarily influenced by factors outside the model, rather than the topics themselves. However, the coefficient tests for individual topics revealed that Topic V2 demonstrated a statistically significant positive influence. After controlling for the effects of other topics, an increase of 1 unit in the probability of Topic V2 (Financial/Money II), relative to the reference group V8, is expected to increase the number of likes by approximately 9.66 (\\(p = 0.038^{*}\\)). This suggests that specific discussion content related to money or finance is more likely to garner attention and agreement within the community. Apart from the intercept, the remaining topics (V1, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7) did not show a statistically significant relationship with the number of likes.\n\nsource(\"Causal_Inference.R\")\n\nRows: 3006 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (9): doc_id, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n[1] \"--- OLS Regression Results (Outcome: likeCount) ---\"\n[1] \"Reference Topic: V8 (PUA/Victim)\"\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = likeCount ~ V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6 + V7, data = merged_df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n -18.59   -8.93   -6.76   -5.12 1763.41 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This specific form of critical discussion related to ‘SIMP’ behavior is extremely negative in sentiment (\\(\\text{mean}\\) \\(\\text{sentiment} = -0.477\\)) and is so unique in its linguistic pattern that its occurrence can be accurately predicted by the supervised learning model. Consequently, the community’s response to ‘SIMP’ behavior is highly concentrated and emotionally charged, with its online visibility predominantly stemming from comments that link the behavior directly to concrete financial inequality and victim scenarios.”"

    "section": "Future",
    "text": "Future\nFuture work should prioritize addressing the observed limitations in both the supervised classification model and the initial data preprocessing pipeline to enhance the robustness and explanatory power of the analysis. Firstly, while the initial Naive Bayes classifier provided baseline insights, its predictive performance should be critically re-evaluated. Improving the accuracy of the automated simp classification label requires exploring more sophisticated machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting, or even Transformer-based deep learning models. Concurrently, enhancing the feature set by refining or expanding the custom dictionaries—perhaps incorporating sentiment scores or incorporating word embeddings—could significantly boost the model’s ability to discriminate between classes, moving beyond simple bag-of-words approaches. Secondly, a crucial area for improvement lies in the token filtering and data processing stage. Despite standard removal procedures, the presence of numerous contextually irrelevant tokens, such as specific objects (“高速公路”) and brands (“麥當勞”), confirms the necessity of a more rigorous, domain-specific cleanup. Future efforts must focus on constructing an expanded, domain-aware stop word list or implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to systematically identify and remove non-topical, low-information tokens, ensuring the remaining features are highly predictive and representative of the core concepts being discussed."

This event, which occurred in Mainland China, provides a particularly rich and relevant dataset because it was a well-documented news story officially reported by the Chinese court. This official documentation makes it a real and verifiable event, distinguishing it from mere rumors or social media anecdotes. Furthermore, the use of Chinese-language videos as the reference source is critical, as the Chinese-speaking audience possesses extensive background knowledge and cultural context directly related to the local details of this incident.\n\nSIMP001 - 陪打遊戲賺百萬養女友慘遭分手！「胖貓事件」引爆中國性別戰爭？「撈女」滿街跑的背後原因？【TODAY 看世界】(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TfkwlthWU&t=13s) 1952 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP002 - 当胖猫遇到捞女，一个年轻人如何走上不归路？｜女权｜捞女｜胖猫｜王者荣耀｜男女平权｜日本｜梅大高速｜舆论控制｜王局拍案20240507 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Gq_eOPuDY&t=1s) 3731 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP003 - 老梁：给“胖猫”多条选择 重庆“胖猫事件”不是性别大战 如何避免成为“胖猫”(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjcgg0wFpfE) 997 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP004 - 小伙為愛跳江，拜金的女友，吸血的親姐，無良的商家，瘋狂的網民，誰才是加害者？為何警察認定女友無罪，反而是親姐違了法？一口氣看完胖貓事件始末！| Wayne調查(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igs7GoIU4MU) 615 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP005 - 神級陪玩「胖貓」遭詐乾227萬亡 女友道歉｜20240506 ET午間新聞 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE83zZEcOY) 402 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP006 - 被撈女騙光50萬，遊戲宅男跳江自殺，轟動全網！撈女譚竹榨乾胖貓事件真相！『新闻最嘲点 姜光宇』2024.0508(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYngd2Yt3zk) 271 comments from 11/04/2025\n\n\nlibrary(plyr)\n\nWarning: package 'plyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise,\n    summarize\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nWarning: package 'tidytext' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'purrr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    compact\n\nlibrary(chromote)\n\nWarning: package 'chromote' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(stargazer)\n\n\nPlease cite as: \n\n\n Hlavac, Marek (2022). stargazer: Well-Formatted Regression and Summary Statistics Tables.\n\n\n R package version 5.2.3. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stargazer \n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\nWarning: package 'corrplot' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n\nlibrary(tm)\n\nWarning: package 'tm' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: NLP\n\n\nWarning: package 'NLP' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'NLP'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\nlibrary(wordcloud)\n\nWarning: package 'wordcloud' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: RColorBrewer\n\nlibrary(quanteda)\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nPackage version: 4.3.1\nUnicode version: 15.1\nICU version: 74.1\n\n\nParallel computing: 12 of 12 threads used.\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'quanteda'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    meta, meta&lt;-\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nWarning: package 'rvest' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textplots\")\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textplots' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr)\n\nWarning: package 'httr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'httr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    content\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(RedditExtractoR)\n\nWarning: package 'RedditExtractoR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nWarning: package 'httr2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments.csv\")\ndata3 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments.csv\")\ndata4 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments.csv\")\ndata5 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments.csv\")\ndata6 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments.csv\")"

The original structure included columns such as: videoId, commentId, parentId, author, text, likeCount, publishedAt, updatedAt, viewerRating, canRate, and reply.\nFor data cleaning, all CSV files in the Final_project_data folder were systematically processed using the R environment. The initial step was to streamline the dataset by retaining only the essential variables for textual and engagement analysis: text, likeCount, and reply.\nI utilized the R packages dplyr and stringr to focus on standardizing the text column. This involved a series of cleaning operations: normalization of whitespace (removing line breaks, tabs, and extra spaces, and trimming leading/trailing whitespace) and character filtering. Crucially, I removed non-essential symbols and unusual characters while meticulously preserving all Chinese characters to ensure the comments remained culturally authentic and meaningful for subsequent analysis.\nFinally, each cleaned and standardized dataset was saved as a new CSV file, appended with the suffix _cleaned. UTF-8 encoding was explicitly used to guarantee the accurate representation of the Chinese characters. This systematic workflow ensures the comment data are tidy, standardized, and immediately ready for downstream procedures, such as tokenization and sentiment or frequency analysis.\n\nsource(\"data_cleaning_CN.R\")\n\ndata cleaning complete!.\n\nSIMP001 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\n\n#Present the eample of the result\nhead(SIMP001)\n\n      videoId                  commentId parentId        author\n1 o5TfkwlthWU UgyekRC230MDXREkdeN4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @DanjonMeshi\n2 o5TfkwlthWU UgxangSP0zjJm6_gHfV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @paullee4451\n3 o5TfkwlthWU UgwZdLtl6Eb2wgDWaDV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;      @urikora\n4 o5TfkwlthWU UgwSmeqUyHYUXGD6l3l4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @fayechen1928\n5 o5TfkwlthWU UgwpotCAmJmn2wWU7u54AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @running_goat\n6 o5TfkwlthWU UgxQSyQbnLT9r7I1faB4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @Jack2006103\n                                                                                                                       text\n1                                                             商家集體給空袋真的笑死，不止生活在中國，連死在中國都要偷著樂😆\n2                                                                                                                      頭香\n3                       更慘的是，人都走了一個月 結果就在這時機點被抓來擋政府做的醜事（路崩華為車衝進去坑洞然後快速燃起來）\n4                                                                                      每次看到中國這種悲劇都覺得不可思議😨😭\n5 我真的必須得說對岸男女戰爭真的越來越嚴重== 問過好幾個對岸的女生都認為男生就是應該要給彩禮 吃飯就是要幫女生付錢等等 很可怕\n6                                                                                                這些店家吃人血饅頭，超噁爛\n  likeCount          publishedAt            updatedAt viewerRating canRate\n1        58 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z         none    TRUE\n2         0 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z         none    TRUE\n3       345 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z         none    TRUE\n4         1 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z         none    TRUE\n5       139 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z         none    TRUE\n6         4 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z         none    TRUE\n  reply\n1 FALSE\n2 FALSE\n3 FALSE\n4 FALSE\n5 FALSE\n6 FALSE\n\ndata1_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata2_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata3_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata4_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata5_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata6_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments_cleaned.csv\")"

First, a Word Cloud visualization (generated using the Word_cloud_visualization.R script) provided an intuitive, qualitative representation of high-frequency words, instantly highlighting the most common terms associated with discussions of “SIMP” behavior.\nSecond, I conducted a quantitative rank-frequency analysis by applying Zipf’s Law to the word corpus. After arranging all unique words by descending frequency and assigning a rank, I plotted the resulting distribution using the ggplot2 package. The resulting visualization confirmed that the comment discourse adheres to a Zipfian distribution, where a few words account for a disproportionate share of the total vocabulary.\nThe key terms driving the discourse were clearly identifiable:\nThese visualizations collectively offer both quantitative validation (Zipf’s Law distribution) and qualitative insight (Word Cloud/Top Terms) into how the audience discusses and perceives the central event and the related concept of “SIMP” behavior in this context.

Each word was repeated according to its frequency (total_count) to create co-occurrence information, which is essential for small datasets where natural co-occurrences are limited. The repeated words were then combined into a single space-separated pseudo-document and used to train a skip-gram Word2Vec model with a vector dimension of 50, window size of 5, and 50 iterations, setting min_count = 1 to include all words.\nThe resulting word vectors allow calculation of cosine similarity to examine semantic relationships between words, as well as clustering and downstream supervised learning tasks. For example, the vector for a keyword such as “為什麼” can be compared with all other word vectors to identify the top semantically similar words, revealing patterns in how concepts related to “SIMP” behavior are discussed in YouTube comments.

The dictionary categorizes words into three groups: positive (supportive or relationship-related words such as “女朋友” and “關心”), negative (critical or unfairness-related words such as “不值得” and “不公平”), and behavior (attention-seeking or “simp” behavior words such as “pua” and “追求”). Using R, I computed sentiment scores for each word in the dataset by summing occurrences in these categories. A raw polarity score was calculated as the sum of positive and behavior counts minus negative counts, then normalized by the total occurrences of all dictionary words to produce a relative polarity measure.\nThe analysis revealed that the current positive and negative categories do not fully capture the sentiment expressed in the comments. Some words were misclassified or contextually ambiguous, highlighting that the dictionary needs further adjustment and refinement to improve accuracy. Polarity distributions were visualized using a histogram, providing an overview of how positive, negative, and behavior-related language appears in discussions of “SIMP” behavior. This approach provides a preliminary sentiment assessment while acknowledging the limitations of the existing dictionary.\n\nsource(\"Sentiment Analysis.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ lubridate 1.9.4\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ NLP::annotate()         masks ggplot2::annotate()\n✖ httr::content()         masks NLP::content()\n✖ dplyr::filter()         masks stats::filter()\n✖ jsonlite::flatten()     masks purrr::flatten()\n✖ rvest::guess_encoding() masks readr::guess_encoding()\n✖ dplyr::lag()            masks stats::lag()\n✖ koRpus::tokenize()      masks readr::tokenize()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textmodels' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stopwords' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'stopwords'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nWarning: package 'caret' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\nAttaching package: 'caret'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:httr':\n\n    progress\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    lift\n\n\n[1] \"DFM after Custom Simp Dictionary Lookup (Counts per category):\"\n\n### SUPERVISED LEARNING (Naive Bayes Classification)\n[1] \"Confusion Matrix:\"\n\n### LEXICON-BASED NTUSD SENTIMENT RESULTS\n[1] \"Mean Sentiment Score by Simping Label (NTUSD):\"\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  contains_simp_factor mean_sentiment\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 FALSE                       -0.0990\n2 TRUE                        -0.477 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph:\nX-Axis: Simping Label:\n\nFALSE: Comments that do not contain any of the words from your custom “simp” dictionary (e.g., “舔狗,” “工具人,” “一廂情願,” etc.).\nTRUE: Comments that do contain at least one word from your custom “simp” dictionary.\n\nY-Axis: Comment Sentiment Score:\n\nPositive Scores (above 0): Indicate a more positive overall sentiment.\nZero (0): Indicates a neutral or balanced sentiment.\nNegative Scores (below 0): Indicate a more negative overall sentiment."

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis Summary\nThe lexicon-based sentiment analysis, utilizing the NTUSD dictionary, reveals a pronounced negative emotional shift in texts discussing the “simp” phenomenon. Specifically, content that contains terms from the custom dictionary—which targets themes like “simp behavior” (e.g., 舔狗, simp), “victim position” (e.g., 受害者, pua), and “relationship imbalance”—shows a highly negative mean sentiment score of -0.477. This score is significantly more negative than the average score of -0.0990 found in texts that do not contain these specific terms. This sharp difference (a nearly five-fold increase in negative sentiment magnitude) indicates that conversations about excessive one-sided effort, perceived exploitation, and unequal relationships—the core of the “simp” concept—are strongly associated with negative emotional discourse within the corpus."

    "text": "Supervised Learning Analysis (Naive Bayes Classification)\nThe Naive Bayes model was employed to classify comments based on whether they contained the “simp” factor, using a cleaned feature set that excluded all words from the custom “simp” dictionary to prevent data leakage. The model achieved an overall Accuracy of 81.69%, which is slightly higher than the No Information Rate (NIR) of 80.36%, indicating its performance is marginally better than random guessing based on class prevalence.\nHowever, a closer look at the results reveals a significant class imbalance issue and skewed performance:\n\nHigh Sensitivity (Recall): The model is excellent at correctly identifying comments that do NOT contain the simp factor (the majority class, FALSE), with a high Sensitivity of 95.72%.\nLow Specificity: Conversely, the model is very poor at correctly identifying comments that DO contain the simp factor (the minority class, TRUE), with a low Specificity of 24.29%.\nKappa Value: The Kappa statistic of 0.2565 suggests only a fair level of agreement beyond chance.\n\nIn summary, the high overall accuracy is largely driven by correctly classifying the prevalent negative class (FALSE). The model struggles to reliably identify actual “simp” comments (TRUE), suggesting that the remaining general vocabulary in the comments lacks sufficient predictive power to consistently distinguish between the two categories without the core dictionary terms.\n\nsource(\"Supervised_Learning.R\")\n\n\n--- Solving Data Leakage: Remove the word which exist in Simp dictionary ---\n[1] \"Original (matrix_main): 2703\"\n[1] \"Remove the word in Simp dictionary (X_cleaned): 2674\"\n\n--- 6.

Crucially, it prunes the vocabulary by removing words that occur less than three times (term_count_min = 3), which helps reduce noise and improves the quality of the derived topics.\nDTM Creation: The processed tokens are converted into a Document-Term Matrix (DTM), which is the input required for LDA.\nModel Training: The script initializes and trains an LDA model with a predefined number of topics (K=8) and 500 iterations.\nOutput: Finally, the code extracts and saves two key results: the Topic-Word distribution (the top 10 most characteristic words for each of the 8 topics) and the Document-Topic distribution (the probability that each comment belongs to each topic), storing both as CSV files for subsequent qualitative analysis.\n\n\nsource(\"Topic_Model.R\")\n\n[1] \"Starting

phenomenon with discussions about specific gender roles and identities within the Chinese context. The presence of “Not worth it” suggests this cluster is focused on evaluating the value of actions/relationships under the PUA framework.\nPUA & Gender Dynamics in China\n\n\nTopic 1\nThis topic mixes uncertainty and specific financial figures (Over 10k yuan), directly linked to PUA. It suggests discussions about high-stakes financial loss or investment by an individual in a relationship where the outcome or reality is unclear.\nFinancial Dimension of PUA & Uncertainty\n\n\nTopic 2\nThe simultaneous presence of “Victim,” “PUA,” and “Truly is” indicates a core discussion cluster dedicated to validating the existence and reality of being exploited. “McDonald’s” implies cheap/casual provision, while “Family’s” suggests the conversation may touch on the origins or impact of these dynamics within a family unit.\nValidating Victimhood & Low-Cost Exploitation\n\n\nTopic 3\nThis topic is saturated with questioning terms (“Is it?”, “Why?”, “Don’t know”), applied directly to boyfriend/girlfriend roles and the concept of gender equality. It represents a pervasive atmosphere of skepticism and critical discussion about expected behavior in modern relationships.\nSkepticism & Questioning of Relationship Roles\n\n\nTopic 4\nA highly polarized topic that denies (不可能, 不存在) the relevance or existence of Male Superiority (男尊女卑). It focuses on the possibility of being together (在一起), suggesting a desire for modern, equal partnerships and a strong rejection of patriarchal norms.\nDenial of Traditional Patriarchy in Relationships\n\n\nTopic 5\nTerms like “More and more” and “Majority” point to a discussion of social trends and scale. When combined with “Victim” and “Girlfriend,” it indicates a conversation about whether victimhood is becoming increasingly common or if the perception of victimhood is changing within the female partner role.\nDiscussing Shifting Social Norms & Victim Pool\n\n\nTopic 6\nThis is the most explicitly transactional topic. It discusses financial payment (RMB) and the concept of a person being reduced to a “Trash Can” (worthless/emotional dumping ground). The use of “And not” suggests a debate over what a relationship should be versus what it currently is (i.e., not a transaction, but one of money/exploitation).\nMonetary Value vs. Emotional Worth (The Price of Simping)\n\n\nTopic 7\nThis topic links resource provision (implied by “Buffet” and “Highway,” often used as metaphors for free/easy access) with discussions of Inequality and Gender Equality. It debates whether resources should be provided freely, who is responsible for providing them, and the resulting fairness in the relationship structure.\nResource Provision & Equality Debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTM\nTopic_Word_Rank\n\n\nV1\nTopic_0\n\n\nV2\nTopic_1\n\n\nV3\nTopic_2\n\n\nV4\nTopic_3\n\n\nV5\nTopic_4\n\n\nV6\nTopic_5\n\n\nV7\nTopic_6\n\n\nV8\nTopic_7"

    "text": "Causal Inference\nIn the casual inference part, I present the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to analyze how the probability of eight LDA topics influences the number of likes received by a comment (likeCount). Topic V8 (PUA/Victim) was set as the reference group (Reference Topic) in the model. Overall, the model’s explanatory power is extremely low (\\(\\text{Adjusted R-squared} = 0.00025\\)), suggesting that the variation in likeCount is primarily influenced by factors outside the model, rather than the topics themselves. However, the coefficient tests for individual topics revealed that Topic V2 demonstrated a statistically significant positive influence. After controlling for the effects of other topics, an increase of 1 unit in the probability of Topic V2 (Financial/Money II), relative to the reference group V8, is expected to increase the number of likes by approximately 9.66 (\\(p = 0.038^{*}\\)). This suggests that specific discussion content related to money or finance is more likely to garner attention and agreement within the community. Apart from the intercept, the remaining topics (V1, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7) did not show a statistically significant relationship with the number of likes.\n\nsource(\"Causal_Inference.R\")\n\nRows: 3006 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (9): doc_id, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n[1] \"--- OLS Regression Results (Outcome: likeCount) ---\"\n[1] \"Reference Topic: V8 (PUA/Victim)\"\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = likeCount ~ V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6 + V7, data = merged_df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n -18.59   -8.93   -6.76   -5.12 1763.41 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This specific form of critical discussion related to ‘SIMP’ behavior is extremely negative in sentiment (\\(\\text{mean}\\) \\(\\text{sentiment} = -0.477\\)) and is so unique in its linguistic pattern that its occurrence can be accurately predicted by the supervised learning model. Consequently, the community’s response to ‘SIMP’ behavior is highly concentrated and emotionally charged, with its online visibility predominantly stemming from comments that link the behavior directly to concrete financial inequality and victim scenarios.”"

    "section": "Future",
    "text": "Future\nFuture work should prioritize addressing the observed limitations in both the supervised classification model and the initial data preprocessing pipeline to enhance the robustness and explanatory power of the analysis. Firstly, while the initial Naive Bayes classifier provided baseline insights, its predictive performance should be critically re-evaluated. Improving the accuracy of the automated simp classification label requires exploring more sophisticated machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting, or even Transformer-based deep learning models. Concurrently, enhancing the feature set by refining or expanding the custom dictionaries—perhaps incorporating sentiment scores or incorporating word embeddings—could significantly boost the model’s ability to discriminate between classes, moving beyond simple bag-of-words approaches. Secondly, a crucial area for improvement lies in the token filtering and data processing stage. Despite standard removal procedures, the presence of numerous contextually irrelevant tokens, such as specific objects (“高速公路”) and brands (“麥當勞”), confirms the necessity of a more rigorous, domain-specific cleanup. Future efforts must focus on constructing an expanded, domain-aware stop word list or implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to systematically identify and remove non-topical, low-information tokens, ensuring the remaining features are highly predictive and representative of the core concepts being discussed."

I utilized an R scraping script to extract approximately 8,000 comments in total. Following a cleaning and filtering process, a dataset of around 7,000 practical comments was retained for analysis.\nI specifically focused on the case study known as the “胖貓跳江事件” (Suicide of Fat Cat). This event, which occurred in Mainland China, provides a particularly rich and relevant dataset because it was a well-documented news story officially reported by the Chinese court. This official documentation makes it a real and verifiable event, distinguishing it from mere rumors or social media anecdotes. Furthermore, the use of Chinese-language videos as the reference source is critical, as the Chinese-speaking audience possesses extensive background knowledge and cultural context directly related to the local details of this incident.\n\nSIMP001 - 陪打遊戲賺百萬養女友慘遭分手！「胖貓事件」引爆中國性別戰爭？「撈女」滿街跑的背後原因？【TODAY 看世界】(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TfkwlthWU&t=13s) 1952 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP002 - 当胖猫遇到捞女，一个年轻人如何走上不归路？｜女权｜捞女｜胖猫｜王者荣耀｜男女平权｜日本｜梅大高速｜舆论控制｜王局拍案20240507 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Gq_eOPuDY&t=1s) 3731 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP003 - 老梁：给“胖猫”多条选择 重庆“胖猫事件”不是性别大战 如何避免成为“胖猫”(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjcgg0wFpfE) 997 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP004 - 小伙為愛跳江，拜金的女友，吸血的親姐，無良的商家，瘋狂的網民，誰才是加害者？為何警察認定女友無罪，反而是親姐違了法？一口氣看完胖貓事件始末！| Wayne調查(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igs7GoIU4MU) 615 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP005 - 神級陪玩「胖貓」遭詐乾227萬亡 女友道歉｜20240506 ET午間新聞 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE83zZEcOY) 402 comments from 11/04/2025\nSIMP006 - 被撈女騙光50萬，遊戲宅男跳江自殺，轟動全網！撈女譚竹榨乾胖貓事件真相！『新闻最嘲点 姜光宇』2024.0508(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYngd2Yt3zk) 271 comments from 11/04/2025\n\n\nlibrary(plyr)\n\nWarning: package 'plyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise,\n    summarize\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nWarning: package 'tidytext' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'purrr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:plyr':\n\n    compact\n\nlibrary(chromote)\n\nWarning: package 'chromote' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(stargazer)\n\n\nPlease cite as: \n\n\n Hlavac, Marek (2022). stargazer: Well-Formatted Regression and Summary Statistics Tables.\n\n\n R package version 5.2.3. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stargazer \n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\nWarning: package 'corrplot' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n\nlibrary(tm)\n\nWarning: package 'tm' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: NLP\n\n\nWarning: package 'NLP' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'NLP'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\nlibrary(wordcloud)\n\nWarning: package 'wordcloud' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: RColorBrewer\n\nlibrary(quanteda)\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nPackage version: 4.3.1\nUnicode version: 15.1\nICU version: 74.1\n\n\nParallel computing: 12 of 12 threads used.\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'quanteda'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    meta, meta&lt;-\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nWarning: package 'rvest' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textplots\")\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textplots' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr)\n\nWarning: package 'httr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'httr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    content\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(RedditExtractoR)\n\nWarning: package 'RedditExtractoR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nWarning: package 'httr2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments.csv\")\ndata3 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments.csv\")\ndata4 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments.csv\")\ndata5 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments.csv\")\ndata6 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments.csv\")"

The original structure included columns such as: videoId, commentId, parentId, author, text, likeCount, publishedAt, updatedAt, viewerRating, canRate, and reply.\nFor data cleaning, all CSV files in the Final_project_data folder were systematically processed using the R environment. The initial step was to streamline the dataset by retaining only the essential variables for textual and engagement analysis: text, likeCount, and reply.\nI utilized the R packages dplyr and stringr to focus on standardizing the text column. This involved a series of cleaning operations: normalization of whitespace (removing line breaks, tabs, and extra spaces, and trimming leading/trailing whitespace) and character filtering. Crucially, I removed non-essential symbols and unusual characters while meticulously preserving all Chinese characters to ensure the comments remained culturally authentic and meaningful for subsequent analysis.\nFinally, each cleaned and standardized dataset was saved as a new CSV file, appended with the suffix _cleaned. UTF-8 encoding was explicitly used to guarantee the accurate representation of the Chinese characters. This systematic workflow ensures the comment data are tidy, standardized, and immediately ready for downstream procedures, such as tokenization and sentiment or frequency analysis.\n\nsource(\"data_cleaning_CN.R\")\n\ndata cleaning complete!.\n\nSIMP001 &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments.csv\")\n\n#Present the eample of the result\nhead(SIMP001)\n\n      videoId                  commentId parentId        author\n1 o5TfkwlthWU UgyekRC230MDXREkdeN4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @DanjonMeshi\n2 o5TfkwlthWU UgxangSP0zjJm6_gHfV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @paullee4451\n3 o5TfkwlthWU UgwZdLtl6Eb2wgDWaDV4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;      @urikora\n4 o5TfkwlthWU UgwSmeqUyHYUXGD6l3l4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @fayechen1928\n5 o5TfkwlthWU UgwpotCAmJmn2wWU7u54AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt; @running_goat\n6 o5TfkwlthWU UgxQSyQbnLT9r7I1faB4AaABAg     &lt;NA&gt;  @Jack2006103\n                                                                                                                       text\n1                                                             商家集體給空袋真的笑死，不止生活在中國，連死在中國都要偷著樂😆\n2                                                                                                                      頭香\n3                       更慘的是，人都走了一個月 結果就在這時機點被抓來擋政府做的醜事（路崩華為車衝進去坑洞然後快速燃起來）\n4                                                                                      每次看到中國這種悲劇都覺得不可思議😨😭\n5 我真的必須得說對岸男女戰爭真的越來越嚴重== 問過好幾個對岸的女生都認為男生就是應該要給彩禮 吃飯就是要幫女生付錢等等 很可怕\n6                                                                                                這些店家吃人血饅頭，超噁爛\n  likeCount          publishedAt            updatedAt viewerRating canRate\n1        58 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z 2024-05-09T16:01:52Z         none    TRUE\n2         0 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z 2024-05-09T16:02:23Z         none    TRUE\n3       345 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z 2024-05-09T16:05:05Z         none    TRUE\n4         1 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z 2024-05-09T16:05:57Z         none    TRUE\n5       139 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z 2024-05-09T16:06:47Z         none    TRUE\n6         4 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z 2024-05-09T16:07:29Z         none    TRUE\n  reply\n1 FALSE\n2 FALSE\n3 FALSE\n4 FALSE\n5 FALSE\n6 FALSE\n\ndata1_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP001_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata2_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP002_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata3_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP003_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata4_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP004_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata5_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP005_comments_cleaned.csv\")\ndata6_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(\"Final_project_data/CN_SIMP006_comments_cleaned.csv\")"

First, a Word Cloud visualization (generated using the Word_cloud_visualization.R script) provided an intuitive, qualitative representation of high-frequency words, instantly highlighting the most common terms associated with discussions of “SIMP” behavior.\nSecond, I conducted a quantitative rank-frequency analysis by applying Zipf’s Law to the word corpus. After arranging all unique words by descending frequency and assigning a rank, I plotted the resulting distribution using the ggplot2 package. The resulting visualization confirmed that the comment discourse adheres to a Zipfian distribution, where a few words account for a disproportionate share of the total vocabulary.\nThe key terms driving the discourse were clearly identifiable:\nThese visualizations collectively offer both quantitative validation (Zipf’s Law distribution) and qualitative insight (Word Cloud/Top Terms) into how the audience discusses and perceives the central event and the related concept of “SIMP” behavior in this context.

Each word was repeated according to its frequency (total_count) to create co-occurrence information, which is essential for small datasets where natural co-occurrences are limited. The repeated words were then combined into a single space-separated pseudo-document and used to train a skip-gram Word2Vec model with a vector dimension of 50, window size of 5, and 50 iterations, setting min_count = 1 to include all words.\nThe resulting word vectors allow calculation of cosine similarity to examine semantic relationships between words, as well as clustering and downstream supervised learning tasks. For example, the vector for a keyword such as “為什麼” can be compared with all other word vectors to identify the top semantically similar words, revealing patterns in how concepts related to “SIMP” behavior are discussed in YouTube comments.

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis\nFor sentiment analysis, I applied a custom Chinese sentiment dictionary tailored to the context of “SIMP” behavior. The dictionary categorizes words into three groups: positive (supportive or relationship-related words such as “女朋友” and “關心”), negative (critical or unfairness-related words such as “不值得” and “不公平”), and behavior (attention-seeking or “simp” behavior words such as “pua” and “追求”). Using R, I computed sentiment scores for each word in the dataset by summing occurrences in these categories. A raw polarity score was calculated as the sum of positive and behavior counts minus negative counts, then normalized by the total occurrences of all dictionary words to produce a relative polarity measure.\nThe analysis revealed that the current positive and negative categories do not fully capture the sentiment expressed in the comments. Some words were misclassified or contextually ambiguous, highlighting that the dictionary needs further adjustment and refinement to improve accuracy. Polarity distributions were visualized using a histogram, providing an overview of how positive, negative, and behavior-related language appears in discussions of “SIMP” behavior. This approach provides a preliminary sentiment assessment while acknowledging the limitations of the existing dictionary.\n\nsource(\"Sentiment Analysis.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ lubridate 1.9.4\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ NLP::annotate()         masks ggplot2::annotate()\n✖ httr::content()         masks NLP::content()\n✖ dplyr::filter()         masks stats::filter()\n✖ jsonlite::flatten()     masks purrr::flatten()\n✖ rvest::guess_encoding() masks readr::guess_encoding()\n✖ dplyr::lag()            masks stats::lag()\n✖ koRpus::tokenize()      masks readr::tokenize()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'quanteda.textmodels' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stopwords' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'stopwords'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nWarning: package 'caret' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\nAttaching package: 'caret'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:httr':\n\n    progress\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    lift\n\n\n[1] \"DFM after Custom Simp Dictionary Lookup (Counts per category):\"\n\n### SUPERVISED LEARNING (Naive Bayes Classification)\n[1] \"Confusion Matrix:\"\n\n### LEXICON-BASED NTUSD SENTIMENT RESULTS\n[1] \"Mean Sentiment Score by Simping Label (NTUSD):\"\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  contains_simp_factor mean_sentiment\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 FALSE                       -0.0990\n2 TRUE                        -0.477 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph:\nX-Axis: Simping Label:\n\nFALSE: Comments that do not contain any of the words from your custom “simp” dictionary (e.g., “舔狗,” “工具人,” “一廂情願,” etc.).\nTRUE: Comments that do contain at least one word from your custom “simp” dictionary.\n\nY-Axis: Comment Sentiment Score:\n\nPositive Scores (above 0): Indicate a more positive overall sentiment.\nZero (0): Indicates a neutral or balanced sentiment.\nNegative Scores (below 0): Indicate a more negative overall sentiment."

    "text": "Sentiment Analysis Summary\nThe lexicon-based sentiment analysis, utilizing the NTUSD dictionary, reveals a pronounced negative emotional shift in texts discussing the “simp” phenomenon. Specifically, content that contains terms from the custom dictionary—which targets themes like “simp behavior” (e.g., 舔狗, simp), “victim position” (e.g., 受害者, pua), and “relationship imbalance”—shows a highly negative mean sentiment score of -0.477. This score is significantly more negative than the average score of -0.0990 found in texts that do not contain these specific terms. This sharp difference (a nearly five-fold increase in negative sentiment magnitude) indicates that conversations about excessive one-sided effort, perceived exploitation, and unequal relationships—the core of the “simp” concept—are strongly associated with negative emotional discourse within the corpus."

    "text": "Supervised Learning Analysis (Naive Bayes Classification)\nThe Naive Bayes model was employed to classify comments based on whether they contained the “simp” factor, using a cleaned feature set that excluded all words from the custom “simp” dictionary to prevent data leakage. The model achieved an overall Accuracy of 81.69%, which is slightly higher than the No Information Rate (NIR) of 80.36%, indicating its performance is marginally better than random guessing based on class prevalence.\nHowever, a closer look at the results reveals a significant class imbalance issue and skewed performance:\n\nHigh Sensitivity (Recall): The model is excellent at correctly identifying comments that do NOT contain the simp factor (the majority class, FALSE), with a high Sensitivity of 95.72%.\nLow Specificity: Conversely, the model is very poor at correctly identifying comments that DO contain the simp factor (the minority class, TRUE), with a low Specificity of 24.29%.\nKappa Value: The Kappa statistic of 0.2565 suggests only a fair level of agreement beyond chance.\n\nIn summary, the high overall accuracy is largely driven by correctly classifying the prevalent negative class (FALSE). The model struggles to reliably identify actual “simp” comments (TRUE), suggesting that the remaining general vocabulary in the comments lacks sufficient predictive power to consistently distinguish between the two categories without the core dictionary terms.\n\nsource(\"Supervised_Learning.R\")\n\n\n--- Solving Data Leakage: Remove the word which exist in Simp dictionary ---\n[1] \"Original (matrix_main): 2703\"\n[1] \"Remove the word in Simp dictionary (X_cleaned): 2674\"\n\n--- 6.

Crucially, it prunes the vocabulary by removing words that occur less than three times (term_count_min = 3), which helps reduce noise and improves the quality of the derived topics.\nDTM Creation: The processed tokens are converted into a Document-Term Matrix (DTM), which is the input required for LDA.\nModel Training: The script initializes and trains an LDA model with a predefined number of topics (K=8) and 500 iterations.\nOutput: Finally, the code extracts and saves two key results: the Topic-Word distribution (the top 10 most characteristic words for each of the 8 topics) and the Document-Topic distribution (the probability that each comment belongs to each topic), storing both as CSV files for subsequent qualitative analysis.\n\n\nsource(\"Topic_Model.R\")\n\n[1] \"Starting

phenomenon with discussions about specific gender roles and identities within the Chinese context. The presence of “Not worth it” suggests this cluster is focused on evaluating the value of actions/relationships under the PUA framework.\nPUA & Gender Dynamics in China\n\n\nTopic 1\nThis topic mixes uncertainty and specific financial figures (Over 10k yuan), directly linked to PUA. It suggests discussions about high-stakes financial loss or investment by an individual in a relationship where the outcome or reality is unclear.\nFinancial Dimension of PUA & Uncertainty\n\n\nTopic 2\nThe simultaneous presence of “Victim,” “PUA,” and “Truly is” indicates a core discussion cluster dedicated to validating the existence and reality of being exploited. “McDonald’s” implies cheap/casual provision, while “Family’s” suggests the conversation may touch on the origins or impact of these dynamics within a family unit.\nValidating Victimhood & Low-Cost Exploitation\n\n\nTopic 3\nThis topic is saturated with questioning terms (“Is it?”, “Why?”, “Don’t know”), applied directly to boyfriend/girlfriend roles and the concept of gender equality. It represents a pervasive atmosphere of skepticism and critical discussion about expected behavior in modern relationships.\nSkepticism & Questioning of Relationship Roles\n\n\nTopic 4\nA highly polarized topic that denies (不可能, 不存在) the relevance or existence of Male Superiority (男尊女卑). It focuses on the possibility of being together (在一起), suggesting a desire for modern, equal partnerships and a strong rejection of patriarchal norms.\nDenial of Traditional Patriarchy in Relationships\n\n\nTopic 5\nTerms like “More and more” and “Majority” point to a discussion of social trends and scale. When combined with “Victim” and “Girlfriend,” it indicates a conversation about whether victimhood is becoming increasingly common or if the perception of victimhood is changing within the female partner role.\nDiscussing Shifting Social Norms & Victim Pool\n\n\nTopic 6\nThis is the most explicitly transactional topic. It discusses financial payment (RMB) and the concept of a person being reduced to a “Trash Can” (worthless/emotional dumping ground). The use of “And not” suggests a debate over what a relationship should be versus what it currently is (i.e., not a transaction, but one of money/exploitation).\nMonetary Value vs. Emotional Worth (The Price of Simping)\n\n\nTopic 7\nThis topic links resource provision (implied by “Buffet” and “Highway,” often used as metaphors for free/easy access) with discussions of Inequality and Gender Equality. It debates whether resources should be provided freely, who is responsible for providing them, and the resulting fairness in the relationship structure.\nResource Provision & Equality Debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTM\nTopic_Word_Rank\n\n\nV1\nTopic_0\n\n\nV2\nTopic_1\n\n\nV3\nTopic_2\n\n\nV4\nTopic_3\n\n\nV5\nTopic_4\n\n\nV6\nTopic_5\n\n\nV7\nTopic_6\n\n\nV8\nTopic_7"

    "text": "Causal Inference\nIn the casual inference part, I present the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to analyze how the probability of eight LDA topics influences the number of likes received by a comment (likeCount). Topic V8 (PUA/Victim) was set as the reference group (Reference Topic) in the model. Overall, the model’s explanatory power is extremely low (\\(\\text{Adjusted R-squared} = 0.00025\\)), suggesting that the variation in likeCount is primarily influenced by factors outside the model, rather than the topics themselves. However, the coefficient tests for individual topics revealed that Topic V2 demonstrated a statistically significant positive influence. After controlling for the effects of other topics, an increase of 1 unit in the probability of Topic V2 (Financial/Money II), relative to the reference group V8, is expected to increase the number of likes by approximately 9.66 (\\(p = 0.038^{*}\\)). This suggests that specific discussion content related to money or finance is more likely to garner attention and agreement within the community. Apart from the intercept, the remaining topics (V1, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7) did not show a statistically significant relationship with the number of likes.\n\nsource(\"Causal_Inference.R\")\n\nRows: 3006 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (9): doc_id, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n[1] \"--- OLS Regression Results (Outcome: likeCount) ---\"\n[1] \"Reference Topic: V8 (PUA/Victim)\"\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = likeCount ~ V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6 + V7, data = merged_df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n -18.59   -8.93   -6.76   -5.12 1763.41 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This specific form of critical discussion related to ‘SIMP’ behavior is extremely negative in sentiment (\\(\\text{mean}\\) \\(\\text{sentiment} = -0.477\\)) and is so unique in its linguistic pattern that its occurrence can be accurately predicted by the supervised learning model. Consequently, the community’s response to ‘SIMP’ behavior is highly concentrated and emotionally charged, with its online visibility predominantly stemming from comments that link the behavior directly to concrete financial inequality and victim scenarios.”"

    "section": "Future",
    "text": "Future\nFuture work should prioritize addressing the observed limitations in both the supervised classification model and the initial data preprocessing pipeline to enhance the robustness and explanatory power of the analysis. Firstly, while the initial Naive Bayes classifier provided baseline insights, its predictive performance should be critically re-evaluated. Improving the accuracy of the automated simp classification label requires exploring more sophisticated machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting, or even Transformer-based deep learning models. Concurrently, enhancing the feature set by refining or expanding the custom dictionaries—perhaps incorporating sentiment scores or incorporating word embeddings—could significantly boost the model’s ability to discriminate between classes, moving beyond simple bag-of-words approaches. Secondly, a crucial area for improvement lies in the token filtering and data processing stage. Despite standard removal procedures, the presence of numerous contextually irrelevant tokens, such as specific objects (“高速公路”) and brands (“麥當勞”), confirms the necessity of a more rigorous, domain-specific cleanup. Future efforts must focus on constructing an expanded, domain-aware stop word list or implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to systematically identify and remove non-topical, low-information tokens, ensuring the remaining features are highly predictive and representative of the core concepts being discussed."

First of all, find the top three global news organizations, such as BBC News, CNN, and Reuters, based on their reputation and audience reach. After that, I will locate their official YouTube channels and select videos with the highest view counts that discuss AI-related topics or trust in AI. This ensures that the data reflects widely viewed content and captures a diverse audience perspective. The third process, using the YouTube API and collecting the comments from the videos that I have selected. After collecting the comments, a data cleaning process will be implemented to remove irrelevant content, such as comments unrelated to AI, spam, emojis, and other unnecessary symbols. This step ensures that the dataset contains meaningful textual information for analysis. After doing the first part of the data cleaning, the comments will be sorted into categories reflecting whether the commenter expresses trust, distrust, or neutral sentiment toward AI decision-making.\n\nView Full Analysis & Report (HTML)"

This study aims to explore two key questions: first, whether students who use generative AI more frequently tend to trust AI-generated content more; and second, whether students from different academic fields vary in their ethical concerns about the use of generative AI. To examine these questions, survey data were collected from university students, focusing on their frequency of AI use, trust levels, and ethical attitudes. The analysis included hypothesis testing and regression modeling to assess the relationships between these variables and provide insight into students’ perspectives on this rapidly evolving technology."

    "text": "Descriptive Statistics\nThis dataset contains survey responses from university students regarding their usage patterns, perceptions, and attitudes toward generative AI technologies like ChatGPT in educational settings. The data frame consists of 184 rows (participants) and multiple columns representing different survey questions.\n\nSelected Variables:\n\nQ1: Academic level.\nQ2: Field of study.\nQ3: Gender identity.\nQ4: Frequency of generative AI use.\nQ5.1 – Q5.6: Perceived benefits of using AI in learning.\nQ6.1 – Q6.8: Concerns or perceived risks.\nQ7.1 – Q7.4: Trust in AI-generated information.\nQ8.1 – Q8.5: Benefit on academic performance or habits.\nQ9.1 – Q9.5: Ethical to use AI in future educational tasks.\n\nFactorizing the Dataset Some variables in the dataset are categorical by nature but may initially be read as character strings or numeric values. To enable appropriate analysis and visualization, these columns were converted into factors with meaningful levels. This step helps in treating variables like gender, academic level, and frequency of AI use as categorical variables rather than continuous or plain text.\nQ1 (Academic Level): Converted into a binary value with levels between Undergraduate and Graduate.\nQ2 (Field of Study): Converted into a factor with levels like Marketing, Finance, Accounting, etc.\nQ3 (Gender): Treated as a binary value from male and female into 0 and 1.\nLikert-Scale Responses (Q4) (Frequency of Generative AI Use): There are five different frequency from Never to Very Often. In this case, we use Likert-Scale to make the data can present correctly.\nLikert-Scale Responses (Q5 to Q9): These responses are ordinal in nature, typically ranging from 1 to 5 (e.g., Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree). These were converted into ordered factors to reflect their ordinal scale for better statistical interpretation.\nThis factorization ensures accurate summarization, plotting, and modeling in further stages of analysis.\n\n# Convert categorical variables to factors\n#Factorizing categorical columns\ndata$Q1 &lt;- factor(data$Q1,\n                  levels = c('Bachelor', 'Master'),\n                  ordered = TRUE)\nQ1_likert_scale &lt;- c(\"Bachelor\" = 0, \"Master\" = 1)\n#Q1_likert_scale &lt;- c(\"Bachelor\" = 0, \"Master\" = 1)\n\n\n#data$Q2 &lt;- relevel(data$Q2, ref = \"Finance\")\ndata$Q2 &lt;- factor(data$Q2,\n                  levels = c(\"Marketing\", \"Finance\", \"Accounting\", \"International Economic Relations\", \"Economics and Business\", \"Economics\"),\n                  ordered = FALSE)\ndata$Q2 &lt;- relevel(data$Q2, ref = \"Finance\")\n\ndata$Q3 &lt;- factor(data$Q3,\n                  levels = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"),\n                  ordered = TRUE)\n\nQ3_likert_scale &lt;- c(\"Male\" = 0, \"Female\" = 1)\n\n\n#data$Q3 &lt;- factor(data$Q3, levels = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"))                   #

    "text": "Conclution\nThis study examined the relationship between students’ generative AI usage and their knowledge and ethical perceptions through four regression models. Model 1, testing the hypothesis that frequent AI use is associated with greater AI knowledge, produced a p-value of 0.1244, indicating no statistically significant relationship at the 0.05 level. Model 2, assessing differences in ethical concerns across academic fields, also yielded a non-significant p-value (0.1848). When control variables such as academic level, gender, and trust were added in Model 3, the p-value increased to 0.3011, further supporting the null hypothesis for Hypothesis 1. However, Model 4, which included controls while testing Hypothesis 2, returned a statistically significant p-value of 0.0295, suggesting that field of study, along with other factors, does significantly relate to students’ ethical concerns about AI. Overall, while no evidence was found to support the idea that frequent AI use improves AI knowledge, the results point to meaningful variation in ethical attitudes depending on students’ academic backgrounds.\n\n# --------------------------------------\n# Question 5: Standardized Regression\n# --------------------------------------\n\n# Standardize continuous variables only\n#model_data$Z_Q1  &lt;- scale(model_data$Q1_likert)\n##model_data$Z_Q3  &lt;- scale(model_data$Q3_likert)\n##model_data$Z_Q4  &lt;- scale(model_data$Q4_likert)\n#model_data$Z_benefit &lt;- scale(model_data$benefit_index)\n\n# Standardize dependent variable\n#model_data$Z_ethics &lt;- scale(model_data$ethics_index)\n\n# Run standardized Model 4\n#model4_std &lt;- lm(Z_ethics ~ Q2 + Z_Q1 + Z_Q3 + Z_Q4 + Z_benefit, data = #model_data)\n\n#summary(model4_std)\n\n#stargazer(model4_std,\n#          title = \"Standardized Model 4 Results\",\n#          type = \"html\",\n#          out = \"standardized_model4_results.html\")#\n\n\n\n# --------------------------------------\n# Question 5 (Option 2): Hypothetical Outcome Plot (HOP)\n# --------------------------------------\n\n# Use Model 4 (your only significant model)\n#set.seed(123)\n\n# Create predicted values from the model\n#model4_pred &lt;- model4\n\n# Create a dataframe with predictions + random noise\n#hop_data &lt;- model_data %&gt;%\n#  mutate(\n#    predicted = predict(model4_pred),\n    # residual standard deviation from model\n#    sigma = summary(model4_pred)$sigma,\n    # simulated outcomes (prediction + random error)\n#    simulated_outcome = predicted + rnorm(n(), mean = 0, sd = sigma)\n#  )\n\n# Plot the Hypothetical Outcome Plot\n#ggplot(hop_data, aes(x = benefit_index, y = simulated_outcome)) +\n#  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n#  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.2) +\n#  labs(title = \"Hypothetical Outcome Plot (HOP)\",\n#       subtitle = \"Simulated outcomes based on Model 4 uncertainty\",\n#       x = \"Benefit Index\",\n#       y = \"Simulated Ethics Index\") +\n#  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n# 1.

    "title": "Group 13 Perception of AI Decision Making",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe experiment investigates how people’s trust in decision-making varies across different risk contexts and decision agents involving artificial intelligence (AI). Participants are randomly assigned to one of six scenarios—three high-risk (e.g., urgent medical decisions) and three low-risk (e.g., playlist creation, blog writing). In each scenario, they are asked who they would trust most to make the decision: a human alone, AI alone, or a form of AI-human collaboration. The study aims to understand how perceived risk levels and task types influence trust in AI, human, and hybrid decision-makers.\n\n\nMethodology\nThis study uses a between-subjects experimental survey design to examine how people’s trust in decision-makers varies across different types of tasks and risk levels. A total of 279 participants were randomly assigned to one of six treatment conditions, each representing a unique scenario involving either a high-risk (e.g., medical diagnosis or urgent treatment decisions) or low-risk (e.g., playlist creation, blog writing, or appointment scheduling) situation. Within each scenario, participants were presented with three to five potential decision-makers: a human alone, an AI alone, or various forms of AI-human collaboration. The treatments vary both in the risk level (high vs. low) and in the task domain (e.g., healthcare vs. entertainment or routine logistics).\nThe main outcome variable, G13_DV, captures the participant’s trust in the decision-maker, with response options ranging from full human control to full AI autonomy. Additional measures such as decision time and click count were collected using embedded Qualtrics timing variables to monitor engagement. Data cleaning procedures included filtering incomplete responses, handling missing values, and recoding scenario conditions into a unified variable (G13_RiskGroup) for analysis. Responses with invalid or blank trust answers were removed, and text responses were standardized using string matching functions. The cleaned dataset allowed for comparisons across scenarios to evaluate how task type and risk influence trust in AI and hybrid decision-making systems.\n\nRisk Groups Explanation\nIn this study, participants were exposed to different activities that were categorized into high-risk and low-risk conditions. Each condition involved different types of tasks that participants were asked to engage in, and the perception of risk was assessed based on their responses. These activities were framed in different ways to test how participants perceive risk in various contexts, particularly in relation to AI involvement.\n\n1. HighRisk_1:\nThis group involved high-risk scenarios, where participants were likely to face situations with significant stakes, either in terms of personal outcome, financial impact, or ethical concerns. These could have included tasks like decision-making in medical, legal, or financial contexts. The idea is that high-risk scenarios typically involve a greater perceived threat of negative outcomes or consequences. In this study, HighRisk_1 specifically involved situations where participants could experience serious consequences, with AI potentially playing a decision-making role in these high-stakes tasks.\n\n\n2. HighRisk_2:\nThis group involved another form of high-risk scenario, but the nature of the task may have differed slightly. The focus in this group was again on situations where the potential for harm or negative outcomes was elevated, though the specific task could have involved different types of challenges. HighRisk_2 was meant to examine risk perception in contexts that might be emotionally or socially risky for the participants, yet still involve high-stakes decisions. For example, it could have involved scenarios where participants had to make important judgments about people’s lives, careers, or futures with AI assistance.\n\n\n3. HighRisk_3:\nThis third high-risk condition followed similar principles to the previous two, but likely involved a different type of high-risk activity, again with a focus on situations that could lead to severe outcomes. The goal was to assess whether the perception of risk in high-stakes environments differs based on the specific context and how AI interaction could alter risk assessments.\n\n\n4. LowRisk_SongColl (Low-Risk - Songwriting Collaboration):\nThis group involved low-risk activities, particularly focusing on a collaborative songwriting task. This scenario was framed as low-risk because there were no significant consequences involved, and participants were asked to collaborate with AI in a creative process. Despite being labeled “low-risk,” the nature of the activity (involving personal creativity and AI collaboration) may have still led to heightened perceptions of risk for some participants, especially those concerned about AI “taking over” the creative process. The study aimed to explore whether collaborative, creative tasks were perceived as riskier, even though they were framed as low-risk tasks.\n\n\n5. LowRisk_Collab (Low-Risk - Collaborative Task):\nThis group also involved low-risk activities, but here, participants engaged in a different collaborative task, possibly involving teamwork with AI in a less creative context. The collaborative aspect was intended to emphasize cooperation with AI, rather than the AI acting as a sole decision-maker. This scenario examined how participants perceive risks when they work together with AI on tasks that are not inherently high-stakes but may still involve a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability.\n\n\n6. LowRisk_BlogWrit (Low-Risk - Blog Writing):\nIn this group, participants engaged in a low-risk activity involving AI-assisted blog writing. The task was framed as a simple, non-consequential task where participants could express their opinions with minimal risk of negative outcomes. While the activity was designed to be low-risk, the goal was to explore whether participants would perceive it differently, considering that their creative output might be influenced or shaped by AI suggestions. This scenario explored the balance between perceived control and the influence of AI on a personal task like writing.\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\nHigh-risk groups involve activities that are associated with significant consequences, either in real life or in perceived impact.\nLow-risk groups involve activities that are generally considered safe, but where the involvement of AI might still influence the participants’ perception of risk, particularly when personal creativity or judgment is involved.\nThe study aimed to compare how risk perception varies across tasks, including creative, decision-making, and collaborative activities, to determine how people assess risk when AI is involved in different types of tasks.\n\nBy examining these risk groups, the study sought to understand how contextual factors, like the nature of the task and the degree of AI involvement, affect individuals’ perceptions of risk.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe used independent-samples t-tests to compare participants’ trust in AI-human decision-makers across different risk conditions. The dependent variable is G13_DV_Likert, a Likert-scale measure (1 = Human alone to 5 = AI alone) indicating participants’ preferred decision-making agent. Each high-risk condition (HighRisk_1, HighRisk_2, HighRisk_3) was compared separately against each low-risk condition (LowRisk_SongColl, LowRisk_Collab, LowRisk_BlogWrit), resulting in multiple pairwise comparisons. This test is appropriate because we are comparing the means of a continuous outcome between two independent groups, and we checked the assumption of equal variances using F-tests before each t-test.\n\n# import libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version

The findings suggest that the format of the task (such as collaborative activities like songwriting) can have a stronger influence on risk perception than the inherent risk of the activity itself. This is an important observation for understanding how context and framing can shape individuals’ attitudes and decisions, especially in environments involving AI, decision-making, or even public policy.\n\nPerception of AI in Collaborative Settings: The stronger risk perception found in the LowRisk_SongColl group (even compared to high-risk conditions) suggests that collaborative, creative tasks may be associated with unpredictability or a sense of loss of control, potentially leading to a heightened sense of risk. This could have broader implications for AI applications in creative fields, where users may overestimate the risks associated with using AI in activities traditionally seen as highly personal or creative.\nRisk Framing: The LowRisk_SongColl activity may have been perceived as involving greater unpredictability, despite being categorized as “low-risk.” It is possible that the creative nature of the task led participants to feel that AI could interfere with or alter their creative expression in unforeseen ways. This finding could challenge traditional thinking about risk in high-stakes decision-making scenarios (like medical or legal contexts), where participants might perceive AI as less risky because the outcomes are more clearly defined.\n\n\n\nPossible Explanations for Unexpected Results\nThe study’s hypothesis posited that low-risk activities (such as creative collaborations) would lead to lower perceived risk compared to high-risk decision-making activities. However, several possible explanations could account for why participants perceived LowRisk_SongColl to be more risky than high-risk scenarios:\n\nFraming Effect: Participants may have been more sensitive to the potential loss of control in a collaborative setting. When working with AI in creative tasks like songwriting, participants may have feared that the AI would overtake the process, leading to unintended or unsatisfactory outcomes. This contrasts with high-risk activities, where the stakes may be more understood or expected.\nLack of Familiarity with AI: The participants’ unfamiliarity with AI-driven collaborative tasks, like songwriting, may have led them to overestimate the potential risks or consequences. When engaging in novel AI interactions, participants often default to caution, fearing that the AI could make decisions that diverge from their intent.\nTask Ambiguity: The low-risk activities (especially the collaborative songwriting task) may have been seen as more ambiguous in terms of risk. While the high-risk conditions might have been easier to categorize, the perceived vagueness of a creative task may have led to a more significant focus on potential risks.\nIndividual Differences: The study did not account for differences in participants’ prior experiences with technology or their levels of comfort in using AI. Those with limited exposure to creative AI tools could have perceived greater risks, whereas those more familiar with AI may have been less apprehensive."
