But it is possible to remove for a fee or using screencapture software. The way to verify non original information presented by an Ai broadcast is to look at other sources just as you would for human broadcasts. I also use it for music. This is more of a mix and master kind of thing though as I work with multiple AI platforms, SUNO, Riffusion, and AIVA. and what I do is download the stems and mix stems from the three different platforms together and on occasion with real life stuff. This makes it near impossible to determine if song or instrumental was created by AI so I have to disclose this in the notes. Usually something ""Created using SUNO and Audacity"" and if I use a real instrument I will include that instrument as well. But my recent understanding is that the streaming services, my music is on Spotify, Iheartradio, and other platforms, they access the notes section of the metadata. They should check the notes section because some artists using AI do put notes there indicating they used AI. This is just in case we want to redo it in the future. We can check the metadata to see how we did it the first time. My spotify say the songs have synthesized voices because AI platforms were really just high advanced and autonomous sound and image synthesizers. Some people may have a hesitation to being required to use the term AI which is why it is better to use the term synthesized instead because it means the same thing: artificially created with advanced autonomous software or AAS. Now the million dollar question is: You create a song on different AI platforms. In my case, I use the same tempo, key, instruments, genre, emotions, themes, etc on all three. Then you download the stems from all three. And say you use audacity or reaper and you mix the stems you like together which actually creates something new and which clearly indicates the song was human created or human directed. It also makes it impossible for software to determine if the song was AI generated because while each stem has a watermark, this process can remove the watermark but in most cases damages it to the point that detection algorithms can't see it. This is why you put ""created using SUNO, Riffusion, AIVA, and whatever else you used"" into the metadata. Speaking of which, it turns out that music created this way is copyrightable because of the human input, direction, and arrangement.",0,"2025-07-26T16:30:29Z","2025-07-26T16:30:29Z","none",TRUE,FALSE

I’ve been using and experimenting with AI for over three years, testing dozens of platforms for both music and video production. My goal has always been to find tools that give more creative control, not less. When I say something isn’t original or is likely replicating existing content, that’s not a guess—it’s based on real use. I stopped uploading videos to YouTube for nearly a year because the AI tools at the time were still stuck in what I call the “slop phase.” Output was messy, inconsistent, and in many cases, the models were clearly using data that felt suspiciously familiar—like they’d been trained on copyrighted or torrented content from sites like PirateBay or similar. In fact, when you see an AI tool recreate a journalist’s voice and report almost exactly, that’s not “new” creation—that’s replication. And that kind of accuracy raises serious ethical questions about how that model was trained. No legitimate model should be able to do that unless it was trained on her original videos without permission. That’s why I’m now much more selective about the platforms I use. For visuals, I use Moonvalley, which trains its models on ethically sourced data and gives me consistency across clips so I can tell a story—not just string together random images. Their Marey character is a major step forward in making AI work with artists instead of against them. For music, I use AIVA, because unlike prompt-only systems, it gives me full creative control—genre, key, instruments, mood, tempo, and more—and it’s also trained on legally licensed music, not pirated material. I’ve also been using Riffusion when I want to fine-tune vocal phrasing or experiment with the sound of the voice itself. If I wanted to, I could even upload my own voice for more personal expression. Suno is trying to move in this direction, but it still has a way to go. So to the commenter who said I ""don’t know how AI works""—I’ve been working directly with it for years, not watching from the sidelines. AI isn’t magical. It needs direction—and when that direction comes from a creator who understands the story they want to tell, AI becomes a tool, not a threat. But let’s not pretend AI doesn’t come with risks. If a model is recreating content that closely, it’s not innovation—it’s imitation, and often based on data that may have been scraped or pirated without consent. That’s not the future we should be building. Ethical AI exists—but only when creators demand it.",3,"2025-07-27T12:01:00Z","2025-07-27T12:01:00Z","none",TRUE,TRUE

The tech certainly gets better, but fake news has existed long, long before AI or computers... probably dating back to when humans first learned to speak & write - and definitely by the time that politics entered the picture. Fake news simply relies on the gullibility of people - on their willingness, and even obsession, to accept lies as truths, rumor & hearsay as fact - and not really so much on tech tricks. This has always been particularly effective when the false narrative plays into any already long held beliefs, or when the source of the narrative comes from a trusted source. Education plays a large part in establishing this behavior, since we are typically taught, esp. as children, to accept what we are told & shown, without question & without additional verification. WIll AI make this situation worse? Almost certainly, in the short-term. But, perhaps, over the long haul, it might actually force people to learn to question & verify more of what they see & hear, rather than accept it at face value.

"SRA4brHXBBQ","Ugxq2ttQu3nyDcqER014AaABAg",NA,"@thebudman1980","The voice sounds the same in most veo3 films with about the same pacing and tone of words of the voice so once you heard one veo3 video they all sound too similar to me. Although they could use other voices from another program or voice act it themselves and sinc it all. I think voice acting over the fake voice would yield the best most realistic results. Because then your voice changes with what you are saying like normal. A persons doesn't use the same ton or pacing constantly with all things they say. So if a person hasn't said every word or sentence and you train on limited media recordings of them. Ai runs into problems of not knowing how that person says that particular word or sentence and that may be different from other things a person says. Their own style that may even be dictated a bit by your emotions at the time such as being excited or happy about something or sad or angry about something. Most people don't pronounce everything perfectly. They pronounced something their way and sometimes their voice makes certain words sound certain ways automatically because how deep their voice is or something. We don't say every word the same as other words we have already said. Anyway the sound of veo3 automatically adding voice sticks out like a sore thumb right now. We may change pitch when we say certain things. Maybe this is to emphasize or to get people to focus on one particular part of something that you want to stress and burn into their heads. When shocked or scared you may normally act differently. Whatever fits personality a bit. What i learned in life. You think you know someone so well you know exactly what they will say about specific things because in your mind it's related to how they responded to what you consider similar things and then your entirely wrong. Your putting words in someone elses mouths and then you find out the hard way sometimes or they cone out. Why would you think i would say or respond that way to that and then you don't realize what they find different about something you find the same as something else. And that is why you shouldn't put words into the mouths of the dead the same as the founding fathers of our country. People often do this when family dies to not honor what they wanted or to believe something else is not true or to justify certain things to themselves. That is when they are wrong. Sometimes it's to make yourself feel better. To lie to yourself because you can't deal with truth is another. So when someone wanted things certain ways you can change this to your way instead. So you can cheat others out of things they wanted to pass down to others instead of yourself or hundreds of other reasons. Putting words into their mouth when alive doesn't work and you will be wrong so you are still wrong when they are no longer alive. S person doesn't change how they thought about things or what they wanted if they wasn't alive. They are only who they was when alive. So if they didn't like the idea of you being in a relationship with someone. You can't go and day now that he isn't alive if he knew he would except it. Nope. Also people lie to themselves because they can't live with themselves or their choices and actions. Or they don't want to change who they are so they want a lie to continue being a certain way while justifying it to self or making themselves feel that something isn't that bad. And they don't want to make changes to be a better person under the actual truth. So they are who they are under the truth and not the lie they make for themselves to continue being who they are and feeling good about it. Likely they won't change either way but some actual would if they convinced themselves of the real truth because their conscious and empathy would stop them. They couldn't bear to do certain bad things to another person having a conscious and empathy.",0,"2025-07-27T16:14:36Z","2025-07-27T16:23:41Z","none",TRUE,FALSE

This glaring inconsistency is a symptom of a deeper crisis—one that has allowed our national discourse to deteriorate into chaos. It is precisely this kind of institutional hypocrisy that fuels public cynicism and emboldens powerful actors, whether human or artificial, to behave without regard for consequence.

InGen engineered clone dinosaurs because they saw a business opportunity: a one of a kind zoo hosting the most famous extinct animals ever. Tech bros likewise just see another business opportunity with AI, a way to make boatloads of money. They are unconcerned with the actual or potential impacts AI can have on society, including further erosion of trust (GenAI is already being used to create fake news), destruction of jobs (nobody is safe from being replaced by a machine), the death of human creativity (which is treated as a commodity), the impact on the environment (those server farms are huge energy hogs).

Don't listen for vocal cues because human voice replication is getting more realistic by the month, but right now, you can still hear the AI voice slightly distorted as if the voice were recorded with a less-than-professional mic. Obvious AI content out there shows outlandish scenarios like a video that has ""massive flood"" in the title and shows a tsunami crashing through a fjord or valley with an impossible amount of water, or a YouTube short of a ""giant sea monster"" shows a massive octopus with 20 arms on a ship's deck. Nearly everybody understands physical body distortions like six or more fingers, growing extra limbs, and key details disappearing, so this is easy to spot. As mentioned in the video, words are still gibberish at this point with AI generations, but that may very well change before the year ends. Please be careful of what you watch and share, and if there is a video that doesn't post an AI disclaimer and very few people have mentioned it's AI, please do so yourself in the comments.",0,"2025-07-28T17:13:15Z","2025-07-28T17:13:15Z","none",TRUE,FALSE

Fil, of Wings of Pegasus, using Pitch Monitoring Software, has analyzed songs, new and remastered, that have been requested by viewers. Here is a partial list of some of those major performers, caught with fake vocals: Eagles, Bee Gees, Freddie Mercury, Simon and Garfunkel, Taylor Swift, Lenny Kravitz, Celine, Pentatonix, Creed, Whitney Houston, Paul McCartney, Ed Sheeran, Pink Floyd, Bryan Adams, Mariah Carey, Charli XCX, Michael Buble, Adam Levine, Ariana Grande, the Wicked film, Sabrina Carpenter, Sir Cliff Richard, Sir Elton John, Dua Lipa, Chicago, Air Supply, Kelly Clarkson Show, The Voice, The X Factor Awards Show, Britain's Got Talent Show, MTV Awards Show, BTS and most K-Pop groups, The First Take Youtube channel, etc. This is now an industry standard practice of all three major labels that control 70% of the music industry directly, Warners, Universal, and Sony. This fakery not only cheats fans but is unfair to artists like Cher, Billie Eilish, Adele, Pink, U2, Carrie Underwood, Lainy Wilson, Pearl Jam, Seal, Simply Red, or Roger Daltry, who don't use it.
