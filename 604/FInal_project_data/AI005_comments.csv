"e85AxYW0Qyk","UgxA4pJ18qaefj8Jb7x4AaABAg",NA,"@repo445-d4h","There are some serious data governance issues with Agentic AIs that a lot of companies are missing and also some up front CapitalX expenses/business process uplifts that most of those looking for one of these solutions are not aware of. For example, I worked with a SMB restaurant to make a front-of-house booking agent that would interact with people on social media, take phone calls, inform potential customers of menu options and health concerns (peanut allergies, vegan food choices, etc), and do basic bookings. Unfortunately, the customer didn't know what internal business tasks needed to be done before they could really onboard an AI Agent. The customer didn't have an up-to-date menu online and the head chef would routinely switch out meals or do specials/deals based on things that suppliers had. The phone line to the company was not able to be re-routed into a cloud environment or online system to provide the necessary hooks for the agent, and the company didn't have a good way of documenting electronically what items might be exposed to different allergies. These issues were overcome but should just stand as a warning for anyone that is hoping that an Agentic AI system can be directly dropped into an existing environment with no uplift from other stakeholders or of business processes. This also is ignoring the entire issue of having an Agentic AI solution that does not process data in house and instead sends that data to an agent (say OpenAI's ChatGPT) for processing as part of a pipeline. If you have proprietary company data, PII data, PCI data, HIPAA data, or any other regulated data types (or you have regional regulation requirements that are applicable to your company, such as GDPR restricted data/responsibilities) you will have more hoops to jump through and more stops added onto your journey to establish an internal Agentic AI system.",0,"2025-08-18T06:23:31Z","2025-08-18T06:23:31Z","none",TRUE,FALSE

The argument that technology will remove the routine, often administrative work suggests that this only provides negatives and is devoid of any benefit. This isn't correct. Having some time doing a task which you can do without being intellectually taxed enables a degree of mental rest. Remove it and you take away mental 'down time'. The technical terms for this is 'work intensity'. That is if the easy stuff is removed, what is left is hard, demanding stuff even if the techno-optimists might call it 'creative work'. Increasing work intensity is linked with increased stress, mental health issues, burnout and ultimately lower productivity. Workers with increased work intensity often seek to restore their work-life-balance, for example through fewer days working. Many economies are showing increasing numbers of workers deciding to work part-time. Another key issue which hasn't been discussed is how AI is reducing the development opportunities of more junior staff. Often the tasks that are being automated are the very tasks that previously junior staff used to do to build experience. I'm not convinced organisations have considered fully the implications of this with long-term firm specific human capital development. I'm convinced that both of these can be mitigated, but those mitigation plans need to be considered and implemented when AI is introduced, and I don't see enough evidence of that happening.",0,"2025-08-18T11:06:18Z","2025-08-18T11:06:18Z","none",TRUE,FALSE

My PhD was on agent systems and state machines and it just makes me laugh my arse off around the nonsense put out there. Here is the big problem which has every tech giant stuck and spinning when it comes to agents: They cannot be debugged. What do I mean by that? With traditional software, when there is any sort of software bug, we use debuggers. We point in break points, which freeze the software in place, we can then observe the state of different variables, or if we wanted to, right down to memory allocation. You then fix that bug, and the system is healthy again. With Agents, this is impossible, utterly impossible. A large language model is completely non-deterministic; it will never have repeatable conditions. Each time you stop it as such, it will be different. It's impossible to predict with the certainty from which we get with normal software. AI is a black box, which is why agents will never be more than at the most things that crawl the web and do research, which is what they are good at. Anything beyond that is just too risky and will remain that way. We have the world's smartest people focused on trying to figure out what the hell is happening in an LLM as no one knows.

"e85AxYW0Qyk","Ugw83fuflKXPDU0pYHd4AaABAg",NA,"@r.a.h.175","Alongside the awesome rise of artificial intelligence (AI), it is vital to pause for deeper contemplation on aspects that often escape the dominant narrative—namely, the metaphysical origin of all knowledge, technology, and progress. A Call to Humility and Reflection 1. The Forgotten Creator: Humanity, wrapped in perpetual arrogance and stubbornness, too often forgets the Source behind all existence and knowledge: Almighty God. In our rush to innovate, what is the origin of our ability to create, understand, and develop technologies such as the car or AI? Are these merely feats of human intellect, or might they be gifts granted by a Higher Power. 2. Beyond Material Causation: Consider the questions: What animates a car, allowing it to carry us, when once only horses could? What hidden reality powers electricity and brings lifeless objects to motion at the flick of a switch? These are not idle questions but prompts for all to reflect on the ultimate Giver of all capacity and energy. 3. Divine Gifts and Their Withdrawal: It is worth pondering whether these very gifts—electricity, machinery, digital systems—could be withdrawn at a moment’s notice by the Almighty. Religious traditions warn of an era where, at the close of time, all such advancements falter: cars refuse to start, jets remain grounded, circuits dead, and even AI ceases to function. Humanity, so consumed by the pride in its intellect, is reminded that what is given can be recalled—“To whom belongs it, to withdraw, to nullify, to dethrone, to call off?” Such humility is rarely found today. 4. The Divine Command “Be and It Is”: The scriptural phrase “Be, and it is” (Arabic: Kun fa-yakun) is repeated throughout the Qur’an, signifying the absolute and effortless creative power of God over all that exists. This principle is found, for example, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:117) and Surah Ya-Sin (36:82), underscoring that all worldly phenomena are contingent upon Divine Will and not merely human endeavor. The Mystery and Limits of Artificial Intelligence 1. AI as Unfolding Energy: Artificial Intelligence, astounding as it is, remains a mysterious derivative of created energy and a manifestation of the interaction between visible and invisible realms. Even now, humanity is dazzled, overwhelmed, and frequently bewitched by the rapid march of AI. There is a collective illusion that our shifting world is solely the brainchild of human ingenuity, neglecting the profound limitations of our understanding. 2. Human Arrogance vs. The Unseen: The reality is this: Man cannot create even the simplest blade of grass, much less fully comprehend the universe or the vast interconnection between the material and supernatural (including beings like the Jinn, referenced in religious traditions to dwell alongside us). Musk, for all his genius, is still distant from this dimension of metaphysical wisdom. 3. Divine Dispensation, Bit by Bit: The incremental unveiling of knowledge—be it electric power, computer logic, or quantum insight—happens not merely by human discovery, but by God’s deliberate generosity. As stated in many religious texts, knowledge descends only by Divine permission and as a trust for human stewardship. Materialism, Greed, and the Search for Truth: 1. The Dazzle of Material Progress: Human beings, infatuated with the sensory pleasures and material gains enabled by technology, often lose sight of the more profound realities. The pursuit of wealth and comfort blinds many to the ultimate truth—our existence is transient, and what truly matters lies beyond consumption and innovation. 2. Scarcity of True Knowledge: There are very few who can genuinely reconcile the burgeoning world of AI with the spiritual, invisible realms. The wisdom of the ancients and the spiritual masters—recorded in scriptures—remains largely unheeded, and those with insight are rare and often silent. Faith, Destiny, and the Unfolding Story: 1. Divine Wisdom Directs All: Almighty God is not arbitrary nor sadistic; as Sovereign, He ultimately steers all matters with justice and wisdom. Every technological leap, economic crisis, and epoch-defining shift carries a purpose—often hidden from immediate view. Everything unfolds according to a plan, and humanity must adapt with humility and insight. 2. The Human Role: While technological and economic shifts reshape our world, let us not be consumed by the illusion of total control. Our charge is to exercise stewardship, cultivate gratitude, and, above all, seek the truth with an open mind and a humble heart. These reflections are not to diminish the extraordinary contributions of science and innovation but to place them within a broader, more enduring perspective. Humankind’s greatest error is pride—the belief in absolute self-sufficiency. Recognizing the limits of our reason and the grandeur of the cosmos invites us to gratitude, awe, and faith; to see every breakthrough as a trust, every challenge as a test, and every era as part of the Almighty’s grand narrative for creation.",0,"2025-09-15T00:28:25Z","2025-09-15T00:28:25Z","none",TRUE,FALSE

This is because these agents first have to be created by us, by telling them which tasks they should take on from us. Since AI systems, and therefore also the agents, still make many mistakes in their processing, our task, if we don't let ourselves be deterred by this, will be to identify these mistakes and influence the agents so that they don't repeat them.
